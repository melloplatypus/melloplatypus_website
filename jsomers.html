              The opening scene of this article is one of my favorites, as it’s more cinematic than most of what I’ve done. It was a joy to research and write: I got to spend time in Utah and Switzerland as ski patrollers fired artillery at the mountainside and scientists studied snowpack at both massive and microscopic scales. This story happened to come out in the second week of March, 2020, and was as a result hardly read, I think; we all had more important things to worry about. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/snow-science-against-the-avalanche">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              What if the best ideas in artificial intelligence are yellowing in a drawer in Bloomington? Douglas Hofstadter, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gödel, Escher, Bach, thinks we've lost sight of what artificial intelligence really means. In this 7,500-word profile for <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, my first article in print, I follow Hofstadter's stubborn quest to replicate the human mind. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              It turns out that there is huge variation in skill among surgeons, and that this is the biggest factor determining the outcome of many surgical procedures. So which surgeon you get matters—a lot. But how do we know who the good ones are?<br><br>
              In this article, I profile a biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering who is developing a program to give surgeons feedback about their performance. Included are two videos—one of a good surgeon, one of a surgeon who's not so good—that everyone should see.

              Something about this essay <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7772557">struck a nerve</a>—it has been read by more than 130,000 people. It's a lament about the state of today's dictionaries, and an argument in favor of using Noah Webster's 1913 edition (with instructions for how to install it).<br><br><em>I don’t want you to conclude that it’s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster’s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. In fact they’re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm’s length from the actual language.</em><br><br>
 
<em>Recall that the New Oxford, for the word “fustian,” gives “pompous or pretentious speech or writing.” I said earlier that that wasn’t even really correct. Here, then, is Webster’s definition: “An inflated style of writing; a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of the thoughts or subject; bombast.” Do you see the difference? What makes fustian fustian is not just that the language is pompous—it’s that this pomposity is above the dignity of the thoughts or subject. It’s using fancy language where fancy language isn’t called for. It’s a subtle difference, but that’s the whole point: English is an awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it’s worse than useless. It’s misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their worth and purpose.</em></div>

				<h2>Books</h2>
				<p class="narrowish">This is a list of the books I've read since my first day at college, arranged basically in the order I read them. I have the list both to jog my memory and because I've read a lot of stuff I've loved, and want other people to find it.</p>

				<ul class="booky_list">
					<li><strong>Neuromancer</strong>, William Gibson.</li>
					<li><strong>Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters</strong> and <strong>Seymour: An Introduction
</strong>, J.D. Salinger.
					</li><li><strong>Narcissus and Goldmund</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>What is Thought?</strong>, Eric Baum.</li>
					<li><strong>My Belief: Essays on Life and Art</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>Naomi</strong>, Junichiro Tanizaki.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America"><strong>The U.S. Constitution</strong></a>.
					</li><li><strong>Demian</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>The Mind's I</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter and Dan Dennett.
						<ul>
							<li>A compendium on the philosophy of mind; Hofstadter and Dennett take turns providing commentary for each of the selected essays/stories.</li>
							<li>
								Highlights: 
								<ol>
									<li>"Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which Turing proposes his eponymous test.</li>
									<li>"The Turing Test: A Coffeehouse Conversation."</li>
									<li>"Minds, Brains, and Programs" (especially Hofstadter's response).</li>
									<li>Thomas Nagel's classic, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"</li>
								</ol>
							</li>	
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Permutation City</strong>, Greg Egan.</li>
					<li><strong>The Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa</strong>, Yukichi Fukuzawa.
					</li><li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2775/2775-h/2775-h.htm"><strong>The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion</strong></a>, Ford Madox Ford.</li>
					<li><strong>The Iliad</strong>, Homer.
					</li><li><strong>Freedom and Neurobiology: Reflections on Free Language Will, and Political Power</strong>, John Searle.
					</li><li><strong>I Am a Strange Loop</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.
						<ul>
							<li>A "softer" and less satisfying version of much of Hofstadter's earlier writing. It may be a good introduction to his ideas for people who don't have time for <em>GEB</em> or find it too technical.</li>
							<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter/dp/0465030785">best pages</a> of this book (from the first chapter) are available in Amazon's "Look Inside" reader.</li>
						</ul>
					</li><li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html"><strong>The Waste Land</strong></a>, T.S. Eliot</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The link above points to the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">raw text online</a> but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Land-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393974995">this print edition</a> has tons of excellent annotations, commentary, and criticism, which are pretty much necessary for a poem this difficult.</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</strong>, Richard P. Feynman</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I have written about Feynman <a href="/blog/feynmans-rigor">here</a>. See this wonderful series of videos, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pYRn5j7oI&amp;feature=related">Fun to Imagine</a>," in which he explains (a) why mirrors seem to reverse left-and-right but not up-and-down, (b) how trains stay on the tracks, and (c) how rubber bands work. Fantastic stuff.</li>
						<li>Other Feynman videos worth watching: <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3164300309410618119#">The Last Journey of a Genius</a>, about his adventure to Tannu Tuva. Warning: a real tear-jerker. Also, of course, <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8777381378502286852#">The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</a>.</li>
						<li>Here's a <a href="http://www.longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/">great short piece</a> on Feynman's involvement with a massively-parallel supercomputer known as "The Connection Machine."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The God Delusion</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.daoisopen.com/ZhuangziTranslation.html"><strong>Zhuangzi</strong></a>, Zhuangzi.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/"><strong>The Elements of Style</strong></a>, William Strunk Jr. and White, E.B.
					<ul>
						<li>This is a classic and is full of excellent advice about style. But it is dangerous, overly prescriptive, and in many places wrong; <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog%2F+strunk+white&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;oq=&amp;fp=6ffc3260debcd3">do a site search</a> on one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">The Language Log</a>, to see all of their carefully argued (and vehement) criticism.</li>
						<li>Also read George Orwell's "<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language.</a>"</li>
					</ul>
					</li><li><strong>The Selfish Gene</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><strong>Lost in the Funhouse</strong>, John Barth.</li>
					<li><strong>Three Lives</strong>, Gertrude Stein.</li>
					<li><strong>Siddhartha</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass,_and_What_Alice_Found_There"><strong>Through the Looking Glass</strong></a>, Lewis Carroll.</li>
					<li><strong>The Analects</strong>, Confucius.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"To learn, and at due times to repeat what one has learnt — is that not after all a pleasure?"</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>To the Lighthouse</strong>, Virginia Woolf</li>
					<li><strong>The Animal Mind</strong>, James L. Gould.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This was heavily cited in Eric Baum's <strong>What is Thought?</strong>, and with good reason: it's full of impressive displays of animal intelligence.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A strange and problematic thesis, but fascinating nonetheless. There is a wonderful line in here where at "odd, unpredictable" moments Dyson found himself "wondering whether trees could think. Not thinking the way we think, but thinking the way trees think; say, two or three hundred years to form the slow trace of an idea."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cosmopolis: The Hidden Agenda of Modernity</strong>, Stephen Toulmin.
					</li><li><strong>Narrative Thought and Narrative Language</strong>, Bruce K. Britton and Anthony D. Pelligrini (eds.).
					</li><li><strong>Life: What a Concept!</strong>, Freeman Dyson, J. Craig Venter, George Church, Robert Shapiro, Dimitar Sasselov, and Seth Lloyd.</li>
					<li><strong>Evariste Galois</strong>, Laura Rigatelli Toti.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">his Wikipedia page</a> — what an exciting and romantic life. I'd like to write a screenplay about it someday.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Art of War</strong>, Sun Tzu.
					</li><li><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</strong>, James Joyce.
					</li><li><strong>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<li><strong>Thus Spake Zarathustra</strong>, Friedrich Nietzsche.
					</li><li><strong>Comeuppance: Costly Altruistic Signaling Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction</strong>, William Flesch.
					</li><li><strong>Franny and Zooey</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<li><strong>Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment</strong>, Richard E. Nisbett and Lee Ross.
					</li><li><strong>Cat's Cradle</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.
					</li><li><strong>Welcome to the Monkey House</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorite collection of Vonnegut stories. What a crisp, straightforward writer, and a brilliant storyteller. He never wastes your time.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Metamagical Themas</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Another compendium from Hofstadter — a collection of all of his <em>Scientific American</em> columns. "Metamagical Themas" is remarkably an anagram of "Mathematical Games," the title of his predecessor Martin Gardner's column (on recreational mathematics). Crazy!</li> 
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</strong>, Timothy Gowers.
					</li><li><strong>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity</strong>, John H. Holland</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I had Holland as a professor at the U of M. He was brilliant, and an excellent teacher. I also recommend his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Chaos-Order-Helix-Books/dp/0738201421"><strong>Emergence: From Chaos To Order</strong></a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A Mathematician's Apology</strong>, G. H. Hardy.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is as good as everyone says it is. Hardy was mostly famous for two things: this book, and discovering the true genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Ramanujan</a>. Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Knew-Infinity-Ramanujan/dp/0671750615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287514463&amp;sr=1-1">a biography</a> of <em>him</em>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A People's History of the United States</strong>, Howard Zinn.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Like Will Hunting says, this one will blow your hair back.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Big Lebowski: The Making of a Coen Brothers Film</strong>, Tricia Cooke and William Preston Robertson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shows the Coen brothers' obsessive attention to detail. Every shot is storyboarded, and every piece of the production — wardrobes, lighting, casting, etc. — is meticulously planned. They're the Joyce of filmmaking.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</strong>, Thomas S. Kuhn</li>
					<li><strong>Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe</strong>, Michel Foucault.</li>
					<li><strong>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of my favorite short fiction is in here. See, e.g., <a href="/bi-20.html">this</a> and <a href="/bi-48.html">this</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Breaking The Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon</strong>, Daniel Dennett.</li>
					<li><strong>Dialogues with Children</strong>, Gareth Mathews.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Proof that children can do philosophy, and a study of an excellent teacher in action.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Remarks on Color</strong>, Ludwig Wittgenstein.
					</li><li><strong>Tao Te Ching</strong>, Laozi.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Drastically overrated.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Diamond Age</strong>, Neal Stephenson.
					</li><li><strong>Hamlet</strong>, William Shakespeare.</li>
					<li><strong>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</strong>, Edward Tufte.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worthwhile even if all you learn is to maximize his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte#Information_design">"data-ink" ratio</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science</strong>, Atul Gawande.</li>
					<li><strong>Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind</strong>, V. S. Ramachandran.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of the coolest — i.e., the most fascinating — stuff I've ever read. This book may tempt you to drop everything for a career in neurology or cognitive neuroscience.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Dubliners</strong>, James Joyce.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My professor called <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/958/">"The Dead"</a> the best short story of all time. "Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Autobiography of Malcolm X</strong>, Malcolm X with Alex Haley.
					</li><li><strong>Nine Stories</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of these stories took Salinger more than a year to write, each. It paid off — they're incredible. Gems.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</strong>, Richard P. Feynman.</li>
					<li><strong>1000 Most Important Words</strong>, Norman W. Schur.</li>
					<li><strong>The Hedgehog and the Fox</strong>, Isaiah Berlin.
					</li><li><strong>Ulysses</strong>, James Joyce.</li>
					<li><strong>Writing in Unreaderly Times</strong>, Kevin Smokler.</li>
					<li><strong>Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service</strong>, Ari Weinzweig.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://zingermans.com">Zingerman's</a>, in Ann Arbor, MI, is arguably the best (and <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030101/25036.html">best-run</a>) deli outside of New York. And part of what makes it so special is their <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/983-good-company-zingermans">highly regarded</a> company culture and especially the way they treat customers. This book is a great guide for doing that yourself, as most of the ideas and advice are less about the restaurant industry than the giving-people-what-they-want industry.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>On Bullshit</strong>, Harry G. Frankfurt.</li>
					<li><strong>I Want to Be a Mathematician</strong>, Paul R. Halmos</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What an incredible book — I will have it by my bedside wherever I live.</li>
						<li>Halmos was a beautiful writer and a hard worker. Here's what he had to say on the subject:
							<blockquote>Archimedes taught us that a small quantity added to itself often enough becomes a large quantity (or, in proverbial terms, every little bit helps). When it comes to accomplishing the bulk of the world's work, and, in particular, when it comes to writing a book, I believe that the converse of Archimedes' teaching is also true: the only way to write a large book is to keep writing a small bit of it, steadily every day, with no exception, with no holiday.</blockquote>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>Snow Crash</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>Godel's Proof</strong>, Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It's hard to overstate the importance of what Godel achieved. Nagel and Newman do a superb job of explaining his remarkably clever and loopy proof, a proof which inspired Hofstadter to write the incomparable <strong>Godel, Escher, Bach</strong>. In fact, this is one of Hofstadter's favorite books.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Winesburg, Ohio</strong>, Sherwood Anderson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A study of "grotesques." As some writer says in the afterword, it has a lot to teach us about humility, ambivalence, and self-doubt.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Equation that Couldn't Be Solved</strong>, Mario Livio.</li>
					<li><strong>The Vagina Monologues</strong>, Eve Ensler.</li>
					<li><strong>Anathem</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>A Man Without a Country</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<li><strong>Systemantics</strong>, John Gall.</li>
					<li><strong>The Dip</strong>, Seth Godin.</li>
					<li><strong>Fear and Trembling</strong>, Soren Kierkegaard.</li>
					<li><strong>Mythologies</strong>, Roland Barthes.</li>
					<li><strong>The Stranger</strong>, Albert Camus.</li>
					<li><strong>Getting to Maybe: How to Excel on Law School Exams</strong>, Richard Michael Fischl and Jeremy Paul.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I wrote about this a bit in <a href="/blog/why-the-law">my piece</a>, "Why the Law"</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Proof</strong>, David Auburn.</li>
					<li><strong>Coders at Work</strong>, Peter Seibel.</li>
					<li><strong>Unaccustomed Earth</strong>, Jhumpa Lahiri.</li>
					<li><strong>Six Easy Pieces</strong>, Richard Feynman.</li>
					<li><strong>Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings from a Lifetime in Golf</strong>, Harvey Penick.</li>
					<li><strong>Lolita</strong>, Vladimir Nabokov.</li>
					<li><strong>How Fiction Works</strong>, James Wood.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I recommend this to any amateur reader (or writer) of fiction. It gives you a great toolbox for thinking about the craft — and it'll make you a better reader.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>This Craft of Verse</strong>, Jorge Luis Borges.</li>
					<li><strong>Envisioning Information</strong>, Edward Tufte.</li>
					<li><strong>The Nine</strong>, Jeffrey Toobin.</li>
					<li><strong>Girl With Curious Hair</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<li><strong>The Best of Isaac Asimov</strong>, Isaac Asimov.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorite stories, in order, were "<a href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">The Last Question</a>," "<a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/HON114/Nightfall.htm">Nightfall</a>," and "Billiard Ball."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Art and Craft of Judging: the Decisions of Judge Learned Hand</strong>, Hershel Shanks.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Fantastic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_Hand">Learned Hand</a> was a beautiful expositor, and a crystal-clear thinker. One of the great minds of his century.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Junk Mail</strong>, Will Self.</li>
					<li><strong>Tinkers</strong>, Paul Harding.</li>
					<li><strong>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</strong>, Richard Feynman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Self-recommending. Read it with an eye toward Feynman's disposition, his particular way of thinking — concretely, simply, with a hard reflex against the <em>illusion</em> of understanding.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Human Stain</strong>, Philip Roth.</li>
					<li><strong>Gang Leader for a Day</strong>, Sudhir Venkatesh.</li>
					<li><strong>Story of My Life</strong>, Jay McInerney.</li>
					<li><strong>The Road</strong>, Cormac McCarthy.</li>
					<li><strong>Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgement</strong>, Allan Gibbard.</li>
					<li><strong>Zen Flesh, Zen Bones</strong>, Paul Reps and Nyogen Senzaki, eds.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Disappointing except for "Centering", which was excellent.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Inside "Jeopardy!": What Really Goes on at TV's Top Quiz Show</strong>, Harry Eisenberg.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There is lots of interesting info about how the show works: how clues are written, researched, vetted, etc., and how individual episodes are produced.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Chomsky-Foucault Debate on Human Nature</strong>, Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault, ed. John Rajchman.</li>
					<li><strong>A Mathematician's Lament: How School Cheats Us Out of Our Most Fascinating and Imaginative Art Form</strong>, Paul Lockhart.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The expanded book version of <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:qcqr-s07yTgJ:www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf+mathematician's+lament&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShtuWAC3pVdpPkCH-J-sRac3MAPc9S-NY4fSzssyuaD8rnZtvotVHKuQRvzhrvT_lfVMUW81NcYWaGkgZbk1bNUKNFmJ2UuhJPsN6vob3nSy23XoAaVUTnwq0b-GTssPJx7Mrwv&amp;sig=AHIEtbS2U273ZekpfeQf0t-taW6Mbzegkg">this wonderful essay</a> on mathematics education.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Look at the Birdie</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<li><strong>The Catcher in the Rye</strong>, J. D. Salinger.</li>
					<li><strong>Dune</strong>, Frank Herbert.</li>
					<li><strong>Wampeters, Foma &amp; Granfalloons (Opinions)</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I particularly liked "Science Fiction", "Excelsior! We're Going to the Moon! Excelsior!", "Why They Read Hesse", "Biafra: A People Betrayed", "Address to Graduating Class at Bennington College, 1970", "Address to the National Institute of Arts And Letters, 1971", "Reflections on My Own Death", "Address at Rededication of Wheaton College Library, 1973", and "Playboy Interview".</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Little Schemer</strong>, Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book. From essentially nothing, it builds you up to the point where you can write (or at least understand) (a) the applicative-order fixed point combinator for functionals, and (b) an interpreter for the very language you're writing in.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/derivation-of-ycombinator">a readable derivation of the Y combinator</a> based on the one given in the book.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps">a more compact attempt</a>, by Paul Graham, to build a Lisp interpreter from the ground up.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem</strong>, ed. Jonathan Shear.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of papers responding to David Chalmers's "<a href="http://consc.net/papers/facing.html">Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness</a>," in which he famously introduces the term "the hard problem." The hard problem is the problem of explaining how first-person phenomenal experiences—colors, tastes, itches, pains, thoughts, moods, mental images, feels, etc.—arise in the brain, which looks to be nothing more than a really complicated collection of jiggling atoms, just like everything else in our physical world.</li>
						<li>A good portion of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=t4KNDxsj7fcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=site:books.google.com+explaining+consciousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o1jQhAg96G&amp;sig=H0Qi6UQuCPAkVPfMtwI-y_d6e3c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hCbhTN6hL4L48AaWjbm7Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">the book</a> is available online at Google Books. Since it's just a collection of papers, it should be easy enough to find whatever you need.</li>
						<li>Chalmers's <a href="http://consc.net/papers/moving.html">response</a> to the responses might be a good way of getting a lay of the land without having to trudge through 400 pages of detailed arguments.</li>
						<li>If anything the book chipped away at my staunch materialism. I feel a lot more open to Chalmers's view, which initially struck me as almost laughably absurd. The hard problem is so hard, I now think, that it warrants quite drastic moves, like introducing something fundamental to the ontology of the world.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Armageddon in Retrospect</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of his writings on war, both fiction and nonfiction. Quite good.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Communication With Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), Proceedings of a conference held at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory, Yerevan, USSR, 5-11 September 1971</strong>, edited by Carl Sagan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>One of maybe two or three of the most interesting books I've read.</li>
						<li>The chief aims of the conference were, first, to estimate values for terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#The_equation">Drake equation</a>, and second, to devise strategies for contact. Necessarily, then, they had to discuss a remarkable range of topics—everything from the chemical origins of life, to the anthropology of early civilizations, to the problem of encoding messages in a form comprehensible to intelligences vastly unlike ourselves.</li>
						<li>The conferencegoers were some of the top scientists from around the	world, chiefly the US and USSR. And if anything the pleasure here is in watching them think and debate in a relatively informal setting. It's a wonderful mix of prepared talks and extemporaneous discussion.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</strong>, Paul Hoffman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book about a wonderful man. Captivating, fast, and fun. Erdős was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived, publishing 1,475 papers, many of them hugely important.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Honeybee Democracy</strong>, Thomas D. Seeley.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>First, Seeley explains in wonderfully lucid detail just how bees go about finding their new homes (nest sites). I came away feeling like an expert on the subject—no doubt a testament to Seeley's expository skill. Second, the illustrations are fantastic: Edward Tufte would be proud. Finally, this serves nicely as a case study in basic science: how to explore, how to ask useful questions, how to design experiments, how to patiently collect data, how to make sense of your results, and how to tell a coherent story about them.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms</strong>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Provocative, in both good and bad ways.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cryptonomicon</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Easily one of my favorite books. This is actually the second time I've read it—the first was in high school, and unfortunately I think much of it went over my head (though it probably influenced me in all kinds of subtle ways). It's a book that repays many returns.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>For a Breath I Tarry</strong>, Roger Zelazny.</li>
					<li><strong>How Animals Work</strong>, Knut Schmidt-Nielsen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There is a surprising and fascinating detail every five pages or so. It gets a bit technical, but the writing is remarkably understated and lucid.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>How the Mind Works</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>And Then We Came to the End</strong>, Joshua Ferris.</li>
					<li><strong>Palindromes and Anagrams</strong>, Howard W. Bergerson.</li>
					<li><strong>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Langauge</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quintessential Hofstadter.</li>
						<li>The index for this book apparently took Hofstadter one full month of fifteen-hour days to pull off, which, when you see it, seems like not nearly enough time!</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Yours Ever: People and Their Letters</strong>, Thomas Mallon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mallon is an excellent editor, writer, and reader, and a wonderful tour guide through centuries of private lives.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</strong>, Keith Johnstone.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Protagoras"><strong>Protagoras</strong></a>, Plato.</li>
					<li><strong>One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science</strong>, George Gamow.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is a book that should be printed in massive quantities and sprinkled everyplace youngsters hang out, in the hope that just a few of them pick it up and delightedly fall headfirst into a life of science.</li>
						<li>Deserving of all its praise (see for example the distribution of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Two-Three-Infinity-Speculations/product-reviews/0486256642/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">reviews on Amazon</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Screwtape Letters</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Incisive chronicle of the many ways humans stray from the good life. Lewis is a master observer of subtly pernicious psychology.</li>
						<li>Amusing, witty, and wise, just like most of Lewis's stuff.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Martian Chronicles</strong>, Ray Bradbury.</li>
					<li><strong>Star Maker</strong>, Olaf Stapledon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Wildly imaginative but maybe too abstract, lacking the standard hooks of successful speculative fiction (like characters, or detailed close-ups of the worlds).</li>
						<li>Stellar prose. It's florid but not purple and laced with an almost biblical majesty.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor</strong>, Paul Farmer.</li>
					<li><strong>Mere Christianity</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<li><strong>C. S. Lewis's Lost Aeneid</strong>, C. S. Lewis, ed. A. T. Reynes.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Lewis is a wonderful translator.</li>
						<li>Only books one, two, and six are translated at any length, enough to show that the Aeneid is a hell of a story.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The John McPhee Reader</strong>, John McPhee, ed. William L. Howarth.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>When I grow up, what would I like to be? A modified John McPhee!</li>
						<li>It's hard to overstate how much I admire McPhee's work and writing. He's a master craftsman. Howarth's introduction tells and the rest of the book shows.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Let the Great World Spin</strong>, Colum McCann.</li>
					<li><strong>Maximum City</strong>, Suketu Mehta.</li>
					<li><strong>Field Notes on Science and Nature</strong>, ed. Michael R. Canfield.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A beautiful, readable, very <em>useful</em> book.</li>
						<li>One is quickly sold on the power of narratives and sketches, and notes in general, for recording information, remembering stuff, and most important, propelling the mind into a reflective observant mode.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Zodiac</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>The Best American Essays (2010)</strong>, ed. Christopher Hitchens.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorites were "Gyromancy," "The Elegant Eyeball," "On John Updike," "Irreconcilable Dissonance," "The Dead Book," and "My Genome, My Self," in that order.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements</strong>, Nils J. Nilsson.</li>
					<li><strong>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: The Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Beatrice and Virgil</strong>, Yann Martel.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very quick read, and very suspenseful. You're drawn through the book on your tiptoes. But I kept waiting for the story to gear up in earnest, and kept waiting, until I had only a slim fingerful of pages left and nothing meaty yet had happened. I was left unsatisfied.</li>
						<li>"Unsatisfied," I say, except that the last few pages, particularly the short "games"... they're incredible.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Angels and Ages: A Short Book About Darwin, Lincoln, and Modern Life</strong>, Adam Gopnik.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Way, way better than you probably think it's going to be. Gopnik is a brilliant essayist.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>REAMDE</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Stephenson is a very indulgent writer. A friend at work said he was like an investigative journalist of his own imagination. When a character plugs in a router, it's 500 words about router configuration; when someone has to pick a lock, it's an essay on lock-picking and hacker culture; anytime a gun goes off it's a very careful description of bolts and safeties and the heft of the thing and firing mechanisms; when the plot calls for a flight across the Pacific it's a whole chapter's worth of great circle routes and the "what it's like" of bizjet travel. All very accurate. This is why I mostly like reading his stuff, because you <em>learn</em> so much in a tasty plot package.</li>
						<li>If I like <em>REAMDE</em> less than some of his other books, though, it's because the stuff he ends up teaching here is not as super interesting as the stuff, say, in <em>Cryptonomicon</em> or <em>The Diamond Age</em>. (I feel like I'd be much better at paintball after reading this book; in fact I was watching Die Hard 2 not too long after and the whole time I was thinking of how pathetically thoughtless all the maneuvers and tactics were in that movie, as compared to what I'd "seen" in Stephenson's book.)</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Sparse Distributed Memory</strong>, Pentti Kanerva.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A coherent high-level account of how memory might work. Neurons are attractors in a space of bitstrings, which code for on/off features in the world. Bitstrings address neurons, which store addresses to other neurons; the chain either diverges (no recall) or converges to the best match.</li>
						<li>The mathematics of the space {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> ensure, first, that any two points chosen at random are far apart, but always closely connectable by a third; and second—for that reason—that a sparse and manageably-sized collection of address decoders (neurons) is sufficient to solve the best-match problem when N is massive (~10,000).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Q.E.D: Beauty in Mathematical Proof</strong>, Burkard Polster.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very short book with beautiful illustrations of elegant proofs.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</strong>, Jon Gertner.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worth reading just for its account of the invention of the transistor. Great material, too, on Claude Shannon.</li>
						<li>Includes a very interesting concluding chapter that tries to explain what made Bell Labs so successful, and where we might find something similar today. Is it Silicon Valley? (No.) Gertner wrote a summary of that argument for the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=all">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry</strong>, Jon Ronson.</li>
					<li><strong>Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche</strong>, Haruki Murakami.</li>
					<li><strong>My First Summer in the Sierra</strong>, John Muir.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What I would give to have one day of Muir's summer, or better yet, one small ounce of his happy attitude.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Lady in the Looking-Glass</strong>, Virginia Woolf.</li>
					<li><strong>The Way of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism</strong>, Martin Buber.</li>
					<li><strong>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</strong>, Douglas Adams.</li>
					<li><strong>Final Approach: The Crash of Eastern 212</strong>, William Stockton.</li>
					<li><strong>The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups</strong>, Randall Stross.</li>
					<li><strong>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</strong>, Bernard Suits.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The editorial review summarizes well: "In the mid twentieth century the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously asserted that games are indefinable; there are no common threads that link them all. 'Nonsense,' says the sensible Bernard Suits: 'playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.' The short book Suits wrote demonstrating precisely that is as playful as it is insightful, as stimulating as it is delightful."</li>
						<li>This book is a shining example of philosophical thinking, of intellectual integrity: it articulates in the best possible light the best objections to its thesis, "come what may." That it manages convincingly to knock them all down is just icing. And in style: it's been a long while since I've read writing this clear, and yet it's not overbearing—it manages to be both precise and light.</li>
						<li>Another one of those special books that I read on a whim and that will, I fear, never be read by anyone I recommend it to.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cloud Atlas</strong>, David Mitchell.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>As good as everyone says. Mitchell is an unbelievable prose stylist.</li>
						<li>My favorite was the long chapter that spanned the middle of the book. I preferred the second halves of the stories more often than the first halves; I particularly enjoyed the second half of the Frobisher letters.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</strong>, Robin Sloan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quick, unserious, but very engrossing. A joy to read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Corrections</strong>, Jonathan Franzen.</li>
					<li><strong>How to Win Friends and Influence People</strong>, Dale Carnegie.</li>
					<ul>
            <li>Rightfully a classic; not so self-helpy as you'd think.</li>
            <li>Quoted on p. 75: "Whenever you go out of doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp."</li>
            <li>Fundamentally people want a sense of importance. "William James said: 'The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.'"</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>The Imperfectionists</strong>, Tom Rachman.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A great read, and devastating.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Both Flesh and Not: Essays</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
          <li><strong>Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
          <li><strong>The Giver</strong>, Lois Lowry.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I remember liking <em>The Giver</em> when I, along with millions of other American kids, read it in middle school. And I remember liking it because it was cryptic—it gestured at something secretly significant. And that in itself is interesting, because re-reading it now I can see that it <em>isn't</em>, as it turns out, a cryptic book. It's actually pretty straightforward—still great, but no longer glowing with some ineffable magic. What does that mean? Does it mean my mind's gotten stronger, or weaker?</li>

      <li><strong>Seveneves</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Stephenson might have the best job in the world. You can see how he uses his novels to dive into subjects that interest him. In that sense he's a lot like a journalist. These projects are an excuse for him to study and talk to smart people and even to do original research over the course of many years. In this book those topics include: orbital mechanics, mining culture, the physics of chains, big space engineering, epigenetics, and glider flight.</li>
        <li>The premise and storyline of this book might be the best Stephenson has ever come up with. The moon blows up in the first sentence; this causes a chain reaction that will, it is calculated, wipe out the planet in two years. The action takes place in three parts; the first and last of these are gripping and fascinating. The last part in particular is fun to read and imaginative. The middle part is a slog, and takes up about ten times too many pages. One consequence of Stephenson being (it seems) a scholar first and a storyteller second is that he indulges in technical detail. When he's describing new worlds, and the story is moving fast (as in the third section), that's welcome—but when the going is slow, all the minutiae is painful.</li>

      <li><strong>The Beautiful and Damned</strong>, F. Scott Fitzgerald</li>
      <li><strong>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work</strong>, Alain de Botton</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An unusual little book that ought to be read widely. It's a generous, funny, thoughtful look at the work that we do now—in logistics, in back offices, in science and infrastructure engineering—and what that means.</li>
        <li>The chapter on painting was my favorite.</li>
        <li>de Botton has a roving, essaying style sort of like DFW's in his nonfiction—he goes places and meets strangers, like a reporter, but instead of merely reporting he shows you what's going on inside his head. It makes for a more entertaining read, and it feels more honest.</li>

      <li><strong>Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis</strong>, Robert F. Kennedy</li>
      <li><strong>The Stand</strong>, Stephen King</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Maybe the most gripping novel I've read. The characters and scenes are incredibly vivid—King writes in a way where you <em>see</em> everything that's happening. And it's hard to imagine a more compelling premise and plot. The characters felt alive.</li>
        <li>This will be my go-to recommendation to anyone looking for a fun, engaging read. The perfect beach or subway book.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Pale Fire</strong>, Vladimir Nabokov</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I believe Kinbote is the author of Canto IV.</li>
        <li>The poem itself is, I think, a great work of literature, and it's a stroke of genius to have embedded it in this strange novel, first because it must have greatly multiplied the poem's audience, and second because it has a way of weakening your critical stance toward it—you don't go into it thinking, "Here's a poem I must criticize," but thinking rather, "Oh, how neat—a little poem."</li>

        <li><strong>The Machinery of Life</strong>, David S. Goodsell</li>
        <ul>
          <li>What a book! Required reading, and especially so for high schoolers and college students. I wasn't much interested in bio as a student but now am hungry to learn more about it, and sort of wish I'd fallen down the rabbit-hole when I was in school. This book would have been a great way in.</li>
          <li>I first heard about it via <a href="http://www.righto.com/2011/07/cells-are-very-fast-and-crowded-places.html">this blog post</a> about how cells are "very fast and crowded places." Indeed, in the first few chapters of the book, this model of the inside of a cell is articulated very clearly.
          <p>I'd always wondered what it meant for genes to be "expressed" and <em>when</em> exactly this would happen, how long it would go on, how often it would be repeated. This book gave me a mental model of the cell that explains gene expression in a simple way: our transcription machinery, like all proteins in the cell, are bouncing around at random, very quickly, encountering other molecules to bind with (or not); when they encounter DNA, they transcribe ("express") it. Gene expression is modulated—genes are "turned off" or on—when the DNA encoding that gene is literally hidden from the transcription machinery, by being packed into the crevasses of tight chromatin bundles.</p></li>

	<ul>
	  <li>Wow! An incredibly captivating read. And complements the movie: both were ideal versions of the story for their form. Here in the book you get lots more motivation and justification—it's very technical to the point of seeming real.</li>
	  <li>Makes me want Crichton's job: study a world of science or engineering in great depth, and as payment, produce page-turning fiction about it.</li>
	  <li>Did you know that at one point, Chrichton <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/michael-crichton-reign-over-pop-culture-jurassic-park-westworld">had</a> the nation's #1 bestselling book, the top movie at the box office, and the most-watched television series, <em>all at the same time</em>—and that this happened TWICE (!)?</li>

	  <li>My friend Ben and I wrote a New York Times crossword puzzle, which appeared in print on Saturday, October 20th 2018. You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/svc/crosswords/v2/puzzle/print/Oct2018.pdf">download it here if you're an NYT subscriber</a>.</li>
          <li>I <a href="features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs">reverse-engineered Google Docs</a> to create <a href="http://draftback.com">Draftback</a>, a tool which allows you to play back any Google Doc's history as though it were a movie. (<a href="http://draftback.com/documents/1fFdqVj7XnBBcKyytm8u8mqMtPInv10ntP79uHICfGVQ">See an example here</a>, from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/watch-me-write-this-article/">FiveThirtyEight article</a> about the tool.) It has more than 300,000 users, most of them teachers and students. Here's a note about how it's being used in the classroom, from <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/draftback-to-the-future-a-tool-for-writing-process-analysis/">the <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em></a>.</li>
          <li>My friend Ben and I made a typewriter that sends its keystrokes in real time to a Google Doc. We call it <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/docwriter">the DocWriter</a>.</li>
          <li>I created a tool for reporters that syncs notes to a recording, and generates a <a href="http://jsomers.net/call">timecoded transcript</a>.</li>
          <li>I've made a very simple typewriter simulator (a text editor where you can't hit Delete) at <a href="http://jsomers.net/typewriter">jsomers.net/typerwriter</a>.</li>
					<li>As discussed in <a href="/blog/directions">this blog post</a>, I tapped into the Google Directions API to answer a few neat questions about driving directions, including "What's the most complicated route in the United States?" The relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/jsomers/directions">here</a>.</li>
					<li>I wrote up my solution to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problem #106 in <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/pe-oeis">this blog post</a>. Here is a more recent <a href="/code/215.html">solution</a>, this time in Ruby, to problem #215. And here's a <a href="/blog/project-euler-problem-191-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-counting-and-love-induction">write-up for problem #191</a>.</li>
					<li>On <a href="/110">this page</a> I wrote some Javascript to quickly generate rows of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110 cellular automaton</a>.</li>

              The opening scene of this article is one of my favorites, as it’s more cinematic than most of what I’ve done. It was a joy to research and write: I got to spend time in Utah and Switzerland as ski patrollers fired artillery at the mountainside and scientists studied snowpack at both massive and microscopic scales. This story happened to come out in the second week of March, 2020, and was as a result hardly read, I think; we all had more important things to worry about. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/snow-science-against-the-avalanche">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              A story about the two most senior engineers at Google, Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, who have built much of the company's most important infrastructure—as a pair. For twenty years, they've worked together at a single computer, one of them working the keyboard, the other sitting back, correcting and cajoling like a producer in a news anchor's ear. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              What if the best ideas in artificial intelligence are yellowing in a drawer in Bloomington? Douglas Hofstadter, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gödel, Escher, Bach, thinks we've lost sight of what artificial intelligence really means. In this 7,500-word profile for <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, my first article in print, I follow Hofstadter's stubborn quest to replicate the human mind. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              This article appeared in the last print edition of the Voice. It started with a tip from a fellow journalist:<br><br>
              
              <em>I was told that the most interesting man in the world works in the archives division of the New York Public Library, and so I went there, one morning this summer, to meet him. My guide, who said it took her a year to learn how to get around the Schwarzman Building on 42nd Street, led us to an elevator off Astor Hall, up past the McGraw Rotunda, through a little door at the back of the Rose Main Reading Room. Our destination was Room 328.</em>

              It turns out that there is huge variation in skill among surgeons, and that this is the biggest factor determining the outcome of many surgical procedures. So which surgeon you get matters—a lot. But how do we know who the good ones are?<br><br>
              In this article, I profile a biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering who is developing a program to give surgeons feedback about their performance. Included are two videos—one of a good surgeon, one of a surgeon who's not so good—that everyone should see.

              <li><a href="/blog/dictionary">You're probably using the wrong dictionary</a>*</li>
              
              Something about this essay <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7772557">struck a nerve</a>—it has been read by more than 130,000 people. It's a lament about the state of today's dictionaries, and an argument in favor of using Noah Webster's 1913 edition (with instructions for how to install it).<br><br><em>I don’t want you to conclude that it’s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster’s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. In fact they’re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm’s length from the actual language.</em><br><br>
 
<em>Recall that the New Oxford, for the word “fustian,” gives “pompous or pretentious speech or writing.” I said earlier that that wasn’t even really correct. Here, then, is Webster’s definition: “An inflated style of writing; a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of the thoughts or subject; bombast.” Do you see the difference? What makes fustian fustian is not just that the language is pompous—it’s that this pomposity is above the dignity of the thoughts or subject. It’s using fancy language where fancy language isn’t called for. It’s a subtle difference, but that’s the whole point: English is an awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it’s worse than useless. It’s misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their worth and purpose.</em></div>

				<h2>Books</h2>
				<p class="narrowish">This is a list of the books I've read since my first day at college, arranged basically in the order I read them. I have the list both to jog my memory and because I've read a lot of stuff I've loved, and want other people to find it.</p>

				<ul class="booky_list">
					<li><strong>Neuromancer</strong>, William Gibson.</li>
					<li><strong>Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters</strong> and <strong>Seymour: An Introduction
</strong>, J.D. Salinger.
					</li><li><strong>Narcissus and Goldmund</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>What is Thought?</strong>, Eric Baum.</li>
					<li><strong>My Belief: Essays on Life and Art</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>Naomi</strong>, Junichiro Tanizaki.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America"><strong>The U.S. Constitution</strong></a>.
					</li><li><strong>Demian</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>The Mind's I</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter and Dan Dennett.
						<ul>
							<li>A compendium on the philosophy of mind; Hofstadter and Dennett take turns providing commentary for each of the selected essays/stories.</li>
							<li>
								Highlights: 
								<ol>
									<li>"Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which Turing proposes his eponymous test.</li>
									<li>"The Turing Test: A Coffeehouse Conversation."</li>
									<li>"Minds, Brains, and Programs" (especially Hofstadter's response).</li>
									<li>Thomas Nagel's classic, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"</li>
								</ol>
							</li>	
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Permutation City</strong>, Greg Egan.</li>
					<li><strong>The Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa</strong>, Yukichi Fukuzawa.
					</li><li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2775/2775-h/2775-h.htm"><strong>The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion</strong></a>, Ford Madox Ford.</li>
					<li><strong>The Iliad</strong>, Homer.
					</li><li><strong>Freedom and Neurobiology: Reflections on Free Language Will, and Political Power</strong>, John Searle.
					</li><li><strong>I Am a Strange Loop</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.
						<ul>
							<li>A "softer" and less satisfying version of much of Hofstadter's earlier writing. It may be a good introduction to his ideas for people who don't have time for <em>GEB</em> or find it too technical.</li>
							<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter/dp/0465030785">best pages</a> of this book (from the first chapter) are available in Amazon's "Look Inside" reader.</li>
						</ul>
					</li><li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html"><strong>The Waste Land</strong></a>, T.S. Eliot</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The link above points to the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">raw text online</a> but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Land-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393974995">this print edition</a> has tons of excellent annotations, commentary, and criticism, which are pretty much necessary for a poem this difficult.</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</strong>, Richard P. Feynman</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I have written about Feynman <a href="/blog/feynmans-rigor">here</a>. See this wonderful series of videos, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pYRn5j7oI&amp;feature=related">Fun to Imagine</a>," in which he explains (a) why mirrors seem to reverse left-and-right but not up-and-down, (b) how trains stay on the tracks, and (c) how rubber bands work. Fantastic stuff.</li>
						<li>Other Feynman videos worth watching: <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3164300309410618119#">The Last Journey of a Genius</a>, about his adventure to Tannu Tuva. Warning: a real tear-jerker. Also, of course, <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8777381378502286852#">The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</a>.</li>
						<li>Here's a <a href="http://www.longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/">great short piece</a> on Feynman's involvement with a massively-parallel supercomputer known as "The Connection Machine."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The God Delusion</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.daoisopen.com/ZhuangziTranslation.html"><strong>Zhuangzi</strong></a>, Zhuangzi.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/"><strong>The Elements of Style</strong></a>, William Strunk Jr. and White, E.B.
					<ul>
						<li>This is a classic and is full of excellent advice about style. But it is dangerous, overly prescriptive, and in many places wrong; <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog%2F+strunk+white&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;oq=&amp;fp=6ffc3260debcd3">do a site search</a> on one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">The Language Log</a>, to see all of their carefully argued (and vehement) criticism.</li>
						<li>Also read George Orwell's "<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language.</a>"</li>
					</ul>
					</li><li><strong>The Selfish Gene</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><strong>Lost in the Funhouse</strong>, John Barth.</li>
					<li><strong>Three Lives</strong>, Gertrude Stein.</li>
					<li><strong>Siddhartha</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass,_and_What_Alice_Found_There"><strong>Through the Looking Glass</strong></a>, Lewis Carroll.</li>
					<li><strong>The Analects</strong>, Confucius.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"To learn, and at due times to repeat what one has learnt — is that not after all a pleasure?"</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>To the Lighthouse</strong>, Virginia Woolf</li>
					<li><strong>The Animal Mind</strong>, James L. Gould.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This was heavily cited in Eric Baum's <strong>What is Thought?</strong>, and with good reason: it's full of impressive displays of animal intelligence.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A strange and problematic thesis, but fascinating nonetheless. There is a wonderful line in here where at "odd, unpredictable" moments Dyson found himself "wondering whether trees could think. Not thinking the way we think, but thinking the way trees think; say, two or three hundred years to form the slow trace of an idea."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cosmopolis: The Hidden Agenda of Modernity</strong>, Stephen Toulmin.
					</li><li><strong>Narrative Thought and Narrative Language</strong>, Bruce K. Britton and Anthony D. Pelligrini (eds.).
					</li><li><strong>Life: What a Concept!</strong>, Freeman Dyson, J. Craig Venter, George Church, Robert Shapiro, Dimitar Sasselov, and Seth Lloyd.</li>
					<li><strong>Evariste Galois</strong>, Laura Rigatelli Toti.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">his Wikipedia page</a> — what an exciting and romantic life. I'd like to write a screenplay about it someday.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Art of War</strong>, Sun Tzu.
					</li><li><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</strong>, James Joyce.
					</li><li><strong>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<li><strong>Thus Spake Zarathustra</strong>, Friedrich Nietzsche.
					</li><li><strong>Comeuppance: Costly Altruistic Signaling Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction</strong>, William Flesch.
					</li><li><strong>Franny and Zooey</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<li><strong>Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment</strong>, Richard E. Nisbett and Lee Ross.
					</li><li><strong>Cat's Cradle</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.
					</li><li><strong>Welcome to the Monkey House</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorite collection of Vonnegut stories. What a crisp, straightforward writer, and a brilliant storyteller. He never wastes your time.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Metamagical Themas</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Another compendium from Hofstadter — a collection of all of his <em>Scientific American</em> columns. "Metamagical Themas" is remarkably an anagram of "Mathematical Games," the title of his predecessor Martin Gardner's column (on recreational mathematics). Crazy!</li> 
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</strong>, Timothy Gowers.
					</li><li><strong>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity</strong>, John H. Holland</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I had Holland as a professor at the U of M. He was brilliant, and an excellent teacher. I also recommend his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Chaos-Order-Helix-Books/dp/0738201421"><strong>Emergence: From Chaos To Order</strong></a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A Mathematician's Apology</strong>, G. H. Hardy.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is as good as everyone says it is. Hardy was mostly famous for two things: this book, and discovering the true genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Ramanujan</a>. Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Knew-Infinity-Ramanujan/dp/0671750615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287514463&amp;sr=1-1">a biography</a> of <em>him</em>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A People's History of the United States</strong>, Howard Zinn.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Like Will Hunting says, this one will blow your hair back.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Big Lebowski: The Making of a Coen Brothers Film</strong>, Tricia Cooke and William Preston Robertson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shows the Coen brothers' obsessive attention to detail. Every shot is storyboarded, and every piece of the production — wardrobes, lighting, casting, etc. — is meticulously planned. They're the Joyce of filmmaking.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</strong>, Thomas S. Kuhn</li>
					<li><strong>Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe</strong>, Michel Foucault.</li>
					<li><strong>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of my favorite short fiction is in here. See, e.g., <a href="/bi-20.html">this</a> and <a href="/bi-48.html">this</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Breaking The Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon</strong>, Daniel Dennett.</li>
					<li><strong>Dialogues with Children</strong>, Gareth Mathews.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Proof that children can do philosophy, and a study of an excellent teacher in action.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Remarks on Color</strong>, Ludwig Wittgenstein.
					</li><li><strong>Tao Te Ching</strong>, Laozi.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Drastically overrated.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Diamond Age</strong>, Neal Stephenson.
					</li><li><strong>Hamlet</strong>, William Shakespeare.</li>
					<li><strong>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</strong>, Edward Tufte.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worthwhile even if all you learn is to maximize his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte#Information_design">"data-ink" ratio</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science</strong>, Atul Gawande.</li>
					<li><strong>Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind</strong>, V. S. Ramachandran.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of the coolest — i.e., the most fascinating — stuff I've ever read. This book may tempt you to drop everything for a career in neurology or cognitive neuroscience.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Dubliners</strong>, James Joyce.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My professor called <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/958/">"The Dead"</a> the best short story of all time. "Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Autobiography of Malcolm X</strong>, Malcolm X with Alex Haley.
					</li><li><strong>Nine Stories</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of these stories took Salinger more than a year to write, each. It paid off — they're incredible. Gems.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</strong>, Richard P. Feynman.</li>
					<li><strong>1000 Most Important Words</strong>, Norman W. Schur.</li>
					<li><strong>The Hedgehog and the Fox</strong>, Isaiah Berlin.
					</li><li><strong>Ulysses</strong>, James Joyce.</li>
					<li><strong>Writing in Unreaderly Times</strong>, Kevin Smokler.</li>
					<li><strong>Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service</strong>, Ari Weinzweig.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://zingermans.com">Zingerman's</a>, in Ann Arbor, MI, is arguably the best (and <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030101/25036.html">best-run</a>) deli outside of New York. And part of what makes it so special is their <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/983-good-company-zingermans">highly regarded</a> company culture and especially the way they treat customers. This book is a great guide for doing that yourself, as most of the ideas and advice are less about the restaurant industry than the giving-people-what-they-want industry.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>On Bullshit</strong>, Harry G. Frankfurt.</li>
					<li><strong>I Want to Be a Mathematician</strong>, Paul R. Halmos</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What an incredible book — I will have it by my bedside wherever I live.</li>
						<li>Halmos was a beautiful writer and a hard worker. Here's what he had to say on the subject:
							<blockquote>Archimedes taught us that a small quantity added to itself often enough becomes a large quantity (or, in proverbial terms, every little bit helps). When it comes to accomplishing the bulk of the world's work, and, in particular, when it comes to writing a book, I believe that the converse of Archimedes' teaching is also true: the only way to write a large book is to keep writing a small bit of it, steadily every day, with no exception, with no holiday.</blockquote>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>Snow Crash</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>Godel's Proof</strong>, Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It's hard to overstate the importance of what Godel achieved. Nagel and Newman do a superb job of explaining his remarkably clever and loopy proof, a proof which inspired Hofstadter to write the incomparable <strong>Godel, Escher, Bach</strong>. In fact, this is one of Hofstadter's favorite books.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Winesburg, Ohio</strong>, Sherwood Anderson.</li>
					<ul>

					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Little Schemer</strong>, Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book. From essentially nothing, it builds you up to the point where you can write (or at least understand) (a) the applicative-order fixed point combinator for functionals, and (b) an interpreter for the very language you're writing in.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/derivation-of-ycombinator">a readable derivation of the Y combinator</a> based on the one given in the book.</li>

					</ul>
					<li><strong>Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem</strong>, ed. Jonathan Shear.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of papers responding to David Chalmers's "<a href="http://consc.net/papers/facing.html">Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness</a>," in which he famously introduces the term "the hard problem." The hard problem is the problem of explaining how first-person phenomenal experiences—colors, tastes, itches, pains, thoughts, moods, mental images, feels, etc.—arise in the brain, which looks to be nothing more than a really complicated collection of jiggling atoms, just like everything else in our physical world.</li>
						<li>A good portion of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=t4KNDxsj7fcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=site:books.google.com+explaining+consciousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o1jQhAg96G&amp;sig=H0Qi6UQuCPAkVPfMtwI-y_d6e3c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hCbhTN6hL4L48AaWjbm7Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">the book</a> is available online at Google Books. Since it's just a collection of papers, it should be easy enough to find whatever you need.</li>
						<li>Chalmers's <a href="http://consc.net/papers/moving.html">response</a> to the responses might be a good way of getting a lay of the land without having to trudge through 400 pages of detailed arguments.</li>
						<li>If anything the book chipped away at my staunch materialism. I feel a lot more open to Chalmers's view, which initially struck me as almost laughably absurd. The hard problem is so hard, I now think, that it warrants quite drastic moves, like introducing something fundamental to the ontology of the world.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Armageddon in Retrospect</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of his writings on war, both fiction and nonfiction. Quite good.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Communication With Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), Proceedings of a conference held at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory, Yerevan, USSR, 5-11 September 1971</strong>, edited by Carl Sagan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>One of maybe two or three of the most interesting books I've read.</li>
						<li>The chief aims of the conference were, first, to estimate values for terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#The_equation">Drake equation</a>, and second, to devise strategies for contact. Necessarily, then, they had to discuss a remarkable range of topics—everything from the chemical origins of life, to the anthropology of early civilizations, to the problem of encoding messages in a form comprehensible to intelligences vastly unlike ourselves.</li>
						<li>The conferencegoers were some of the top scientists from around the	world, chiefly the US and USSR. And if anything the pleasure here is in watching them think and debate in a relatively informal setting. It's a wonderful mix of prepared talks and extemporaneous discussion.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</strong>, Paul Hoffman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book about a wonderful man. Captivating, fast, and fun. Erdős was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived, publishing 1,475 papers, many of them hugely important.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Honeybee Democracy</strong>, Thomas D. Seeley.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>First, Seeley explains in wonderfully lucid detail just how bees go about finding their new homes (nest sites). I came away feeling like an expert on the subject—no doubt a testament to Seeley's expository skill. Second, the illustrations are fantastic: Edward Tufte would be proud. Finally, this serves nicely as a case study in basic science: how to explore, how to ask useful questions, how to design experiments, how to patiently collect data, how to make sense of your results, and how to tell a coherent story about them.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms</strong>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Provocative, in both good and bad ways.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cryptonomicon</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Easily one of my favorite books. This is actually the second time I've read it—the first was in high school, and unfortunately I think much of it went over my head (though it probably influenced me in all kinds of subtle ways). It's a book that repays many returns.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>For a Breath I Tarry</strong>, Roger Zelazny.</li>
					<li><strong>How Animals Work</strong>, Knut Schmidt-Nielsen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There is a surprising and fascinating detail every five pages or so. It gets a bit technical, but the writing is remarkably understated and lucid.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>How the Mind Works</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>And Then We Came to the End</strong>, Joshua Ferris.</li>
					<li><strong>Palindromes and Anagrams</strong>, Howard W. Bergerson.</li>
					<li><strong>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Langauge</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quintessential Hofstadter.</li>
						<li>The index for this book apparently took Hofstadter one full month of fifteen-hour days to pull off, which, when you see it, seems like not nearly enough time!</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Yours Ever: People and Their Letters</strong>, Thomas Mallon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mallon is an excellent editor, writer, and reader, and a wonderful tour guide through centuries of private lives.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</strong>, Keith Johnstone.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Protagoras"><strong>Protagoras</strong></a>, Plato.</li>
					<li><strong>One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science</strong>, George Gamow.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is a book that should be printed in massive quantities and sprinkled everyplace youngsters hang out, in the hope that just a few of them pick it up and delightedly fall headfirst into a life of science.</li>
						<li>Deserving of all its praise (see for example the distribution of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Two-Three-Infinity-Speculations/product-reviews/0486256642/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">reviews on Amazon</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Screwtape Letters</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Incisive chronicle of the many ways humans stray from the good life. Lewis is a master observer of subtly pernicious psychology.</li>
						<li>Amusing, witty, and wise, just like most of Lewis's stuff.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Martian Chronicles</strong>, Ray Bradbury.</li>
					<li><strong>Star Maker</strong>, Olaf Stapledon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Wildly imaginative but maybe too abstract, lacking the standard hooks of successful speculative fiction (like characters, or detailed close-ups of the worlds).</li>
						<li>Stellar prose. It's florid but not purple and laced with an almost biblical majesty.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor</strong>, Paul Farmer.</li>
					<li><strong>Mere Christianity</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<li><strong>C. S. Lewis's Lost Aeneid</strong>, C. S. Lewis, ed. A. T. Reynes.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Lewis is a wonderful translator.</li>
						<li>Only books one, two, and six are translated at any length, enough to show that the Aeneid is a hell of a story.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The John McPhee Reader</strong>, John McPhee, ed. William L. Howarth.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>When I grow up, what would I like to be? A modified John McPhee!</li>
						<li>It's hard to overstate how much I admire McPhee's work and writing. He's a master craftsman. Howarth's introduction tells and the rest of the book shows.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Let the Great World Spin</strong>, Colum McCann.</li>
					<li><strong>Maximum City</strong>, Suketu Mehta.</li>
					<li><strong>Field Notes on Science and Nature</strong>, ed. Michael R. Canfield.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A beautiful, readable, very <em>useful</em> book.</li>
						<li>One is quickly sold on the power of narratives and sketches, and notes in general, for recording information, remembering stuff, and most important, propelling the mind into a reflective observant mode.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Zodiac</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>The Best American Essays (2010)</strong>, ed. Christopher Hitchens.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorites were "Gyromancy," "The Elegant Eyeball," "On John Updike," "Irreconcilable Dissonance," "The Dead Book," and "My Genome, My Self," in that order.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements</strong>, Nils J. Nilsson.</li>
					<li><strong>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: The Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Beatrice and Virgil</strong>, Yann Martel.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very quick read, and very suspenseful. You're drawn through the book on your tiptoes. But I kept waiting for the story to gear up in earnest, and kept waiting, until I had only a slim fingerful of pages left and nothing meaty yet had happened. I was left unsatisfied.</li>
						<li>"Unsatisfied," I say, except that the last few pages, particularly the short "games"... they're incredible.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Angels and Ages: A Short Book About Darwin, Lincoln, and Modern Life</strong>, Adam Gopnik.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Way, way better than you probably think it's going to be. Gopnik is a brilliant essayist.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>REAMDE</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Stephenson is a very indulgent writer. A friend at work said he was like an investigative journalist of his own imagination. When a character plugs in a router, it's 500 words about router configuration; when someone has to pick a lock, it's an essay on lock-picking and hacker culture; anytime a gun goes off it's a very careful description of bolts and safeties and the heft of the thing and firing mechanisms; when the plot calls for a flight across the Pacific it's a whole chapter's worth of great circle routes and the "what it's like" of bizjet travel. All very accurate. This is why I mostly like reading his stuff, because you <em>learn</em> so much in a tasty plot package.</li>
						<li>If I like <em>REAMDE</em> less than some of his other books, though, it's because the stuff he ends up teaching here is not as super interesting as the stuff, say, in <em>Cryptonomicon</em> or <em>The Diamond Age</em>. (I feel like I'd be much better at paintball after reading this book; in fact I was watching Die Hard 2 not too long after and the whole time I was thinking of how pathetically thoughtless all the maneuvers and tactics were in that movie, as compared to what I'd "seen" in Stephenson's book.)</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Sparse Distributed Memory</strong>, Pentti Kanerva.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A coherent high-level account of how memory might work. Neurons are attractors in a space of bitstrings, which code for on/off features in the world. Bitstrings address neurons, which store addresses to other neurons; the chain either diverges (no recall) or converges to the best match.</li>
						<li>The mathematics of the space {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> ensure, first, that any two points chosen at random are far apart, but always closely connectable by a third; and second—for that reason—that a sparse and manageably-sized collection of address decoders (neurons) is sufficient to solve the best-match problem when N is massive (~10,000).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Q.E.D: Beauty in Mathematical Proof</strong>, Burkard Polster.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very short book with beautiful illustrations of elegant proofs.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</strong>, Jon Gertner.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worth reading just for its account of the invention of the transistor. Great material, too, on Claude Shannon.</li>
						<li>Includes a very interesting concluding chapter that tries to explain what made Bell Labs so successful, and where we might find something similar today. Is it Silicon Valley? (No.) Gertner wrote a summary of that argument for the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=all">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry</strong>, Jon Ronson.</li>
					<li><strong>Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche</strong>, Haruki Murakami.</li>
					<li><strong>My First Summer in the Sierra</strong>, John Muir.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What I would give to have one day of Muir's summer, or better yet, one small ounce of his happy attitude.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Lady in the Looking-Glass</strong>, Virginia Woolf.</li>
					<li><strong>The Way of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism</strong>, Martin Buber.</li>
					<li><strong>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</strong>, Douglas Adams.</li>
					<li><strong>Final Approach: The Crash of Eastern 212</strong>, William Stockton.</li>
					<li><strong>The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups</strong>, Randall Stross.</li>
					<li><strong>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</strong>, Bernard Suits.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The editorial review summarizes well: "In the mid twentieth century the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously asserted that games are indefinable; there are no common threads that link them all. 'Nonsense,' says the sensible Bernard Suits: 'playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.' The short book Suits wrote demonstrating precisely that is as playful as it is insightful, as stimulating as it is delightful."</li>
						<li>This book is a shining example of philosophical thinking, of intellectual integrity: it articulates in the best possible light the best objections to its thesis, "come what may." That it manages convincingly to knock them all down is just icing. And in style: it's been a long while since I've read writing this clear, and yet it's not overbearing—it manages to be both precise and light.</li>
						<li>Another one of those special books that I read on a whim and that will, I fear, never be read by anyone I recommend it to.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cloud Atlas</strong>, David Mitchell.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>As good as everyone says. Mitchell is an unbelievable prose stylist.</li>
						<li>My favorite was the long chapter that spanned the middle of the book. I preferred the second halves of the stories more often than the first halves; I particularly enjoyed the second half of the Frobisher letters.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</strong>, Robin Sloan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quick, unserious, but very engrossing. A joy to read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Corrections</strong>, Jonathan Franzen.</li>
					<li><strong>How to Win Friends and Influence People</strong>, Dale Carnegie.</li>
					<ul>
            <li>Rightfully a classic; not so self-helpy as you'd think.</li>
            <li>Quoted on p. 75: "Whenever you go out of doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp."</li>
            <li>Fundamentally people want a sense of importance. "William James said: 'The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.'"</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>The Imperfectionists</strong>, Tom Rachman.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A great read, and devastating.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Both Flesh and Not: Essays</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
          <li><strong>Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
          <li><strong>The Giver</strong>, Lois Lowry.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I remember liking <em>The Giver</em> when I, along with millions of other American kids, read it in middle school. And I remember liking it because it was cryptic—it gestured at something secretly significant. And that in itself is interesting, because re-reading it now I can see that it <em>isn't</em>, as it turns out, a cryptic book. It's actually pretty straightforward—still great, but no longer glowing with some ineffable magic. What does that mean? Does it mean my mind's gotten stronger, or weaker?</li>

      <li><strong>Seveneves</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Stephenson might have the best job in the world. You can see how he uses his novels to dive into subjects that interest him. In that sense he's a lot like a journalist. These projects are an excuse for him to study and talk to smart people and even to do original research over the course of many years. In this book those topics include: orbital mechanics, mining culture, the physics of chains, big space engineering, epigenetics, and glider flight.</li>
        <li>The premise and storyline of this book might be the best Stephenson has ever come up with. The moon blows up in the first sentence; this causes a chain reaction that will, it is calculated, wipe out the planet in two years. The action takes place in three parts; the first and last of these are gripping and fascinating. The last part in particular is fun to read and imaginative. The middle part is a slog, and takes up about ten times too many pages. One consequence of Stephenson being (it seems) a scholar first and a storyteller second is that he indulges in technical detail. When he's describing new worlds, and the story is moving fast (as in the third section), that's welcome—but when the going is slow, all the minutiae is painful.</li>

      <li><strong>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work</strong>, Alain de Botton</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An unusual little book that ought to be read widely. It's a generous, funny, thoughtful look at the work that we do now—in logistics, in back offices, in science and infrastructure engineering—and what that means.</li>
        <li>The chapter on painting was my favorite.</li>
        <li>de Botton has a roving, essaying style sort of like DFW's in his nonfiction—he goes places and meets strangers, like a reporter, but instead of merely reporting he shows you what's going on inside his head. It makes for a more entertaining read, and it feels more honest.</li>

      <li><strong>The Stand</strong>, Stephen King</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Maybe the most gripping novel I've read. The characters and scenes are incredibly vivid—King writes in a way where you <em>see</em> everything that's happening. And it's hard to imagine a more compelling premise and plot. The characters felt alive.</li>
        <li>This will be my go-to recommendation to anyone looking for a fun, engaging read. The perfect beach or subway book.</li>

      <li><strong>Pale Fire</strong>, Vladimir Nabokov</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I believe Kinbote is the author of Canto IV.</li>
        <li>The poem itself is, I think, a great work of literature, and it's a stroke of genius to have embedded it in this strange novel, first because it must have greatly multiplied the poem's audience, and second because it has a way of weakening your critical stance toward it—you don't go into it thinking, "Here's a poem I must criticize," but thinking rather, "Oh, how neat—a little poem."</li>

        <li>My book group has been reading <em>Ulysses</em>, and this guide has been indispensable—reading it before each chapter of <em>U</em> made what was literally going on in each scene vastly more accessible.</li>

      <li><strong>Sourdough</strong>, Robin Sloan</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Such a joyful book—and a joy to read. I may have even liked it more than <em>Penumbra</em>. This one has that same infectious love for the world.</li>

        <li><strong>Once a Runner</strong>, John L. Parker Jr.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>More people should write books like this: fictional odes to the thing they love.</li>

        <li><strong>The Machinery of Life</strong>, David S. Goodsell</li>
        <ul>
          <li>What a book! Required reading, and especially so for high schoolers and college students. I wasn't much interested in bio as a student but now am hungry to learn more about it, and sort of wish I'd fallen down the rabbit-hole when I was in school. This book would have been a great way in.</li>
          <li>I first heard about it via <a href="http://www.righto.com/2011/07/cells-are-very-fast-and-crowded-places.html">this blog post</a> about how cells are "very fast and crowded places." Indeed, in the first few chapters of the book, this model of the inside of a cell is articulated very clearly.
          <p>I'd always wondered what it meant for genes to be "expressed" and <em>when</em> exactly this would happen, how long it would go on, how often it would be repeated. This book gave me a mental model of the cell that explains gene expression in a simple way: our transcription machinery, like all proteins in the cell, are bouncing around at random, very quickly, encountering other molecules to bind with (or not); when they encounter DNA, they transcribe ("express") it. Gene expression is modulated—genes are "turned off" or on—when the DNA encoding that gene is literally hidden from the transcription machinery, by being packed into the crevasses of tight chromatin bundles.</p></li>
          <li>There are lots of drawings by Goodsell, along with videos, explanations, and other stuff, at the <a href="http://pdb101.rcsb.org/">protein data bank</a>.</li>
          <li>There are some excerpts on <a href="/machinery-of-life.html">this page</a>.</li>

          <li>There are some open questions I had after reading the book on <a href="/cajal-questions.html">this page</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</strong>, James D. Watson</li>

        <li><strong>I, Claudius</strong>, Robert Graves</li>
        <li><strong>Sex and the City</strong>, Candace Bushnell</li>
        <li><strong>Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th-century Admiral Turned Science into Poetry</strong>, Scott Huler</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A surprisingly wonderful book whose basic point is to pay closer attention to the world around you—a bit like <i>Field Notes on Science and Nature</i>.</li>
          <li>I was inspired to write my own <a href="/beaufort-turbulence.html">Beaufortian scale for airplane turbulence</a>.</li>

	<li><strong>11/22/63</strong>, Stephen King.</li>
	<li><strong>Sing, Unburied, Sing</strong>, Jesmyn Ward.</li>
	<li><strong>Jurassic Park</strong>, Michael Crichton.</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Wow! An incredibly captivating read. And complements the movie: both were ideal versions of the story for their form. Here in the book you get lots more motivation and justification—it's very technical to the point of seeming real.</li>
	  <li>Makes me want Crichton's job: study a world of science or engineering in great depth, and as payment, produce page-turning fiction about it.</li>
	  <li>Did you know that at one point, Chrichton <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/michael-crichton-reign-over-pop-culture-jurassic-park-westworld">had</a> the nation's #1 bestselling book, the top movie at the box office, and the most-watched television series, <em>all at the same time</em>—and that this happened TWICE (!)?</li>

	  <li>My friend Ben and I wrote a New York Times crossword puzzle, which appeared in print on Saturday, October 20th 2018. You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/svc/crosswords/v2/puzzle/print/Oct2018.pdf">download it here if you're an NYT subscriber</a>.</li>
          <li>I <a href="features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs">reverse-engineered Google Docs</a> to create <a href="http://draftback.com">Draftback</a>, a tool which allows you to play back any Google Doc's history as though it were a movie. (<a href="http://draftback.com/documents/1fFdqVj7XnBBcKyytm8u8mqMtPInv10ntP79uHICfGVQ">See an example here</a>, from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/watch-me-write-this-article/">FiveThirtyEight article</a> about the tool.) It has more than 300,000 users, most of them teachers and students. Here's a note about how it's being used in the classroom, from <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/draftback-to-the-future-a-tool-for-writing-process-analysis/">the <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em></a>.</li>
          <li>My friend Ben and I made a typewriter that sends its keystrokes in real time to a Google Doc. We call it <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/docwriter">the DocWriter</a>.</li>
          <li>I created a tool for reporters that syncs notes to a recording, and generates a <a href="http://jsomers.net/call">timecoded transcript</a>.</li>
          <li>I've made a very simple typewriter simulator (a text editor where you can't hit Delete) at <a href="http://jsomers.net/typewriter">jsomers.net/typerwriter</a>.</li>
					<li>As discussed in <a href="/blog/directions">this blog post</a>, I tapped into the Google Directions API to answer a few neat questions about driving directions, including "What's the most complicated route in the United States?" The relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/jsomers/directions">here</a>.</li>
					<li>I wrote up my solution to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problem #106 in <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/pe-oeis">this blog post</a>. Here is a more recent <a href="/code/215.html">solution</a>, this time in Ruby, to problem #215. And here's a <a href="/blog/project-euler-problem-191-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-counting-and-love-induction">write-up for problem #191</a>.</li>

              The opening scene of this article is one of my favorites, as it’s more cinematic than most of what I’ve done.

              What if the best ideas in artificial intelligence are yellowing in a drawer in Bloomington? Douglas Hofstadter, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gödel, Escher, Bach, thinks we've lost sight of what artificial intelligence really means. In this 7,500-word profile for <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, my first article in print, I follow Hofstadter's stubborn quest to replicate the human mind. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

My guide, who said it took her a year to learn how to get around the Schwarzman Building on 42nd Street, led us to an elevator off Astor Hall, up past the McGraw Rotunda, through a little door at the back of the Rose Main Reading Room. Our destination was Room 328.</em>

              It turns out that there is huge variation in skill among surgeons, and that this is the biggest factor determining the outcome of many surgical procedures. So which surgeon you get matters—a lot. But how do we know who the good ones are?<br><br>
              In this article, I profile a biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering who is developing a program to give surgeons feedback about their performance. Included are two videos—one of a good surgeon, one of a surgeon who's not so good—that everyone should see.

              Something about this essay <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7772557">struck a nerve</a>—it has been read by more than 130,000 people. It's a lament about the state of today's dictionaries, and an argument in favor of using Noah Webster's 1913 edition (with instructions for how to install it).<br><br><em>I don’t want you to conclude that it’s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster’s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. In fact they’re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm’s length from the actual language.</em><br><br>
 
<em>Recall that the New Oxford, for the word “fustian,” gives “pompous or pretentious speech or writing.” I said earlier that that wasn’t even really correct. Here, then, is Webster’s definition: “An inflated style of writing; a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of the thoughts or subject; bombast.” Do you see the difference? What makes fustian fustian is not just that the language is pompous—it’s that this pomposity is above the dignity of the thoughts or subject. It’s using fancy language where fancy language isn’t called for. It’s a subtle difference, but that’s the whole point: English is an awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it’s worse than useless. It’s misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their worth and purpose.</em></div>

						<ul>
							<li>A "softer" and less satisfying version of much of Hofstadter's earlier writing. It may be a good introduction to his ideas for people who don't have time for <em>GEB</em> or find it too technical.</li>

					<li><strong>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</strong>, Richard P. Feynman</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I have written about Feynman <a href="/blog/feynmans-rigor">here</a>. See this wonderful series of videos, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pYRn5j7oI&amp;feature=related">Fun to Imagine</a>," in which he explains (a) why mirrors seem to reverse left-and-right but not up-and-down, (b) how trains stay on the tracks, and (c) how rubber bands work. Fantastic stuff.</li>
						<li>Other Feynman videos worth watching: <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3164300309410618119#">The Last Journey of a Genius</a>, about his adventure to Tannu Tuva. Warning: a real tear-jerker. Also, of course, <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8777381378502286852#">The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</a>.</li>

						<li>This is a classic and is full of excellent advice about style.

					</ul>
					<li><strong>Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A strange and problematic thesis, but fascinating nonetheless. There is a wonderful line in here where at "odd, unpredictable" moments Dyson found himself "wondering whether trees could think. Not thinking the way we think, but thinking the way trees think; say, two or three hundred years to form the slow trace of an idea."</li>

					</ul>
					<li><strong>Metamagical Themas</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Another compendium from Hofstadter — a collection of all of his <em>Scientific American</em> columns. "Metamagical Themas" is remarkably an anagram of "Mathematical Games," the title of his predecessor Martin Gardner's column (on recreational mathematics). Crazy!</li>

						<li>This is as good as everyone says it is.

					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Big Lebowski: The Making of a Coen Brothers Film</strong>, Tricia Cooke and William Preston Robertson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shows the Coen brothers' obsessive attention to detail. Every shot is storyboarded, and every piece of the production — wardrobes, lighting, casting, etc. — is meticulously planned. They're the Joyce of filmmaking.</li>

					<li><strong>Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service</strong>, Ari Weinzweig.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://zingermans.com">Zingerman's</a>, in Ann Arbor, MI, is arguably the best (and <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030101/25036.html">best-run</a>) deli outside of New York. And part of what makes it so special is their <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/983-good-company-zingermans">highly regarded</a> company culture and especially the way they treat customers. This book is a great guide for doing that yourself, as most of the ideas and advice are less about the restaurant industry than the giving-people-what-they-want industry.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>On Bullshit</strong>, Harry G. Frankfurt.</li>
					<li><strong>I Want to Be a Mathematician</strong>, Paul R. Halmos</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What an incredible book — I will have it by my bedside wherever I live.</li>
						<li>Halmos was a beautiful writer and a hard worker. Here's what he had to say on the subject:
							<blockquote>Archimedes taught us that a small quantity added to itself often enough becomes a large quantity (or, in proverbial terms, every little bit helps). When it comes to accomplishing the bulk of the world's work, and, in particular, when it comes to writing a book, I believe that the converse of Archimedes' teaching is also true: the only way to write a large book is to keep writing a small bit of it, steadily every day, with no exception, with no holiday.</blockquote>

					<li><strong>The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>Snow Crash</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>Godel's Proof</strong>, Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It's hard to overstate the importance of what Godel achieved. Nagel and Newman do a superb job of explaining his remarkably clever and loopy proof, a proof which inspired Hofstadter to write the incomparable <strong>Godel, Escher, Bach</strong>. In fact, this is one of Hofstadter's favorite books.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Winesburg, Ohio</strong>, Sherwood Anderson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A study of "grotesques." As some writer says in the afterword, it has a lot to teach us about humility, ambivalence, and self-doubt.</li>

					<li><strong>Tinkers</strong>, Paul Harding.</li>
					<li><strong>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</strong>, Richard Feynman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Self-recommending. Read it with an eye toward Feynman's disposition, his particular way of thinking — concretely, simply, with a hard reflex against the <em>illusion</em> of understanding.</li>

					<ul>
						<li>I particularly liked "Science Fiction", "Excelsior! We're Going to the Moon! Excelsior!", "Why They Read Hesse", "Biafra: A People Betrayed", "Address to Graduating Class at Bennington College, 1970", "Address to the National Institute of Arts And Letters, 1971", "Reflections on My Own Death", "Address at Rededication of Wheaton College Library, 1973", and "Playboy Interview".</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Little Schemer</strong>, Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book. From essentially nothing, it builds you up to the point where you can write (or at least understand) (a) the applicative-order fixed point combinator for functionals, and (b) an interpreter for the very language you're writing in.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/derivation-of-ycombinator">a readable derivation of the Y combinator</a> based on the one given in the book.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps">a more compact attempt</a>, by Paul Graham, to build a Lisp interpreter from the ground up.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem</strong>, ed. Jonathan Shear.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of papers responding to David Chalmers's "<a href="http://consc.net/papers/facing.html">Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness</a>," in which he famously introduces the term "the hard problem." The hard problem is the problem of explaining how first-person phenomenal experiences—colors, tastes, itches, pains, thoughts, moods, mental images, feels, etc.—arise in the brain, which looks to be nothing more than a really complicated collection of jiggling atoms, just like everything else in our physical world.</li>
						<li>A good portion of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=t4KNDxsj7fcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=site:books.google.com+explaining+consciousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o1jQhAg96G&amp;sig=H0Qi6UQuCPAkVPfMtwI-y_d6e3c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hCbhTN6hL4L48AaWjbm7Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">the book</a> is available online at Google Books. Since it's just a collection of papers, it should be easy enough to find whatever you need.</li>
						<li>Chalmers's <a href="http://consc.net/papers/moving.html">response</a> to the responses might be a good way of getting a lay of the land without having to trudge through 400 pages of detailed arguments.</li>
						<li>If anything the book chipped away at my staunch materialism. I feel a lot more open to Chalmers's view, which initially struck me as almost laughably absurd. The hard problem is so hard, I now think, that it warrants quite drastic moves, like introducing something fundamental to the ontology of the world.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Armageddon in Retrospect</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of his writings on war, both fiction and nonfiction. Quite good.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Communication With Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), Proceedings of a conference held at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory, Yerevan, USSR, 5-11 September 1971</strong>, edited by Carl Sagan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>One of maybe two or three of the most interesting books I've read.</li>
						<li>The chief aims of the conference were, first, to estimate values for terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#The_equation">Drake equation</a>, and second, to devise strategies for contact. Necessarily, then, they had to discuss a remarkable range of topics—everything from the chemical origins of life, to the anthropology of early civilizations, to the problem of encoding messages in a form comprehensible to intelligences vastly unlike ourselves.</li>
						<li>The conferencegoers were some of the top scientists from around the	world, chiefly the US and USSR. And if anything the pleasure here is in watching them think and debate in a relatively informal setting. It's a wonderful mix of prepared talks and extemporaneous discussion.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</strong>, Paul Hoffman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book about a wonderful man. Captivating, fast, and fun. Erdős was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived, publishing 1,475 papers, many of them hugely important.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Honeybee Democracy</strong>, Thomas D. Seeley.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>First, Seeley explains in wonderfully lucid detail just how bees go about finding their new homes (nest sites). I came away feeling like an expert on the subject—no doubt a testament to Seeley's expository skill. Second, the illustrations are fantastic: Edward Tufte would be proud. Finally, this serves nicely as a case study in basic science: how to explore, how to ask useful questions, how to design experiments, how to patiently collect data, how to make sense of your results, and how to tell a coherent story about them.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms</strong>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Provocative, in both good and bad ways.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cryptonomicon</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Easily one of my favorite books. This is actually the second time I've read it—the first was in high school, and unfortunately I think much of it went over my head (though it probably influenced me in all kinds of subtle ways). It's a book that repays many returns.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>For a Breath I Tarry</strong>, Roger Zelazny.</li>
					<li><strong>How Animals Work</strong>, Knut Schmidt-Nielsen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There is a surprising and fascinating detail every five pages or so. It gets a bit technical, but the writing is remarkably understated and lucid.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>How the Mind Works</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>And Then We Came to the End</strong>, Joshua Ferris.</li>
					<li><strong>Palindromes and Anagrams</strong>, Howard W. Bergerson.</li>
					<li><strong>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Langauge</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quintessential Hofstadter.</li>
						<li>The index for this book apparently took Hofstadter one full month of fifteen-hour days to pull off, which, when you see it, seems like not nearly enough time!</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Yours Ever: People and Their Letters</strong>, Thomas Mallon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mallon is an excellent editor, writer, and reader, and a wonderful tour guide through centuries of private lives.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</strong>, Keith Johnstone.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Protagoras"><strong>Protagoras</strong></a>, Plato.</li>
					<li><strong>One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science</strong>, George Gamow.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is a book that should be printed in massive quantities and sprinkled everyplace youngsters hang out, in the hope that just a few of them pick it up and delightedly fall headfirst into a life of science.</li>
						<li>Deserving of all its praise (see for example the distribution of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Two-Three-Infinity-Speculations/product-reviews/0486256642/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">reviews on Amazon</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Screwtape Letters</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Incisive chronicle of the many ways humans stray from the good life. Lewis is a master observer of subtly pernicious psychology.</li>
						<li>Amusing, witty, and wise, just like most of Lewis's stuff.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Martian Chronicles</strong>, Ray Bradbury.</li>
					<li><strong>Star Maker</strong>, Olaf Stapledon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Wildly imaginative but maybe too abstract, lacking the standard hooks of successful speculative fiction (like characters, or detailed close-ups of the worlds).</li>
						<li>Stellar prose. It's florid but not purple and laced with an almost biblical majesty.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor</strong>, Paul Farmer.</li>
					<li><strong>Mere Christianity</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<li><strong>C. S. Lewis's Lost Aeneid</strong>, C. S. Lewis, ed. A. T. Reynes.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Lewis is a wonderful translator.</li>
						<li>Only books one, two, and six are translated at any length, enough to show that the Aeneid is a hell of a story.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The John McPhee Reader</strong>, John McPhee, ed. William L. Howarth.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>When I grow up, what would I like to be? A modified John McPhee!</li>
						<li>It's hard to overstate how much I admire McPhee's work and writing. He's a master craftsman. Howarth's introduction tells and the rest of the book shows.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Let the Great World Spin</strong>, Colum McCann.</li>
					<li><strong>Maximum City</strong>, Suketu Mehta.</li>
					<li><strong>Field Notes on Science and Nature</strong>, ed. Michael R. Canfield.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A beautiful, readable, very <em>useful</em> book.</li>
						<li>One is quickly sold on the power of narratives and sketches, and notes in general, for recording information, remembering stuff, and most important, propelling the mind into a reflective observant mode.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Zodiac</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>The Best American Essays (2010)</strong>, ed. Christopher Hitchens.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorites were "Gyromancy," "The Elegant Eyeball," "On John Updike," "Irreconcilable Dissonance," "The Dead Book," and "My Genome, My Self," in that order.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements</strong>, Nils J. Nilsson.</li>
					<li><strong>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: The Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Beatrice and Virgil</strong>, Yann Martel.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very quick read, and very suspenseful. You're drawn through the book on your tiptoes. But I kept waiting for the story to gear up in earnest, and kept waiting, until I had only a slim fingerful of pages left and nothing meaty yet had happened. I was left unsatisfied.</li>
						<li>"Unsatisfied," I say, except that the last few pages, particularly the short "games"... they're incredible.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Angels and Ages: A Short Book About Darwin, Lincoln, and Modern Life</strong>, Adam Gopnik.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Way, way better than you probably think it's going to be. Gopnik is a brilliant essayist.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>REAMDE</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Stephenson is a very indulgent writer. A friend at work said he was like an investigative journalist of his own imagination. When a character plugs in a router, it's 500 words about router configuration; when someone has to pick a lock, it's an essay on lock-picking and hacker culture; anytime a gun goes off it's a very careful description of bolts and safeties and the heft of the thing and firing mechanisms; when the plot calls for a flight across the Pacific it's a whole chapter's worth of great circle routes and the "what it's like" of bizjet travel. All very accurate. This is why I mostly like reading his stuff, because you <em>learn</em> so much in a tasty plot package.</li>
						<li>If I like <em>REAMDE</em> less than some of his other books, though, it's because the stuff he ends up teaching here is not as super interesting as the stuff, say, in <em>Cryptonomicon</em> or <em>The Diamond Age</em>. (I feel like I'd be much better at paintball after reading this book; in fact I was watching Die Hard 2 not too long after and the whole time I was thinking of how pathetically thoughtless all the maneuvers and tactics were in that movie, as compared to what I'd "seen" in Stephenson's book.)</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Sparse Distributed Memory</strong>, Pentti Kanerva.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A coherent high-level account of how memory might work. Neurons are attractors in a space of bitstrings, which code for on/off features in the world. Bitstrings address neurons, which store addresses to other neurons; the chain either diverges (no recall) or converges to the best match.</li>
						<li>The mathematics of the space {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> ensure, first, that any two points chosen at random are far apart, but always closely connectable by a third; and second—for that reason—that a sparse and manageably-sized collection of address decoders (neurons) is sufficient to solve the best-match problem when N is massive (~10,000).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Q.E.D: Beauty in Mathematical Proof</strong>, Burkard Polster.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very short book with beautiful illustrations of elegant proofs.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</strong>, Jon Gertner.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worth reading just for its account of the invention of the transistor. Great material, too, on Claude Shannon.</li>
						<li>Includes a very interesting concluding chapter that tries to explain what made Bell Labs so successful, and where we might find something similar today. Is it Silicon Valley? (No.) Gertner wrote a summary of that argument for the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=all">here</a>.</li>

					<li><strong>Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche</strong>, Haruki Murakami.</li>
					<li><strong>My First Summer in the Sierra</strong>, John Muir.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What I would give to have one day of Muir's summer, or better yet, one small ounce of his happy attitude.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Lady in the Looking-Glass</strong>, Virginia Woolf.</li>
					<li><strong>The Way of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism</strong>, Martin Buber.</li>
					<li><strong>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</strong>, Douglas Adams.</li>
					<li><strong>Final Approach: The Crash of Eastern 212</strong>, William Stockton.</li>
					<li><strong>The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups</strong>, Randall Stross.</li>
					<li><strong>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</strong>, Bernard Suits.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The editorial review summarizes well: "In the mid twentieth century the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously asserted that games are indefinable; there are no common threads that link them all. 'Nonsense,' says the sensible Bernard Suits: 'playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.' The short book Suits wrote demonstrating precisely that is as playful as it is insightful, as stimulating as it is delightful."</li>
						<li>This book is a shining example of philosophical thinking, of intellectual integrity: it articulates in the best possible light the best objections to its thesis, "come what may." That it manages convincingly to knock them all down is just icing. And in style: it's been a long while since I've read writing this clear, and yet it's not overbearing—it manages to be both precise and light.</li>
						<li>Another one of those special books that I read on a whim and that will, I fear, never be read by anyone I recommend it to.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cloud Atlas</strong>, David Mitchell.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>As good as everyone says. Mitchell is an unbelievable prose stylist.</li>
						<li>My favorite was the long chapter that spanned the middle of the book. I preferred the second halves of the stories more often than the first halves; I particularly enjoyed the second half of the Frobisher letters.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</strong>, Robin Sloan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quick, unserious, but very engrossing. A joy to read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Corrections</strong>, Jonathan Franzen.</li>
					<li><strong>How to Win Friends and Influence People</strong>, Dale Carnegie.</li>
					<ul>
            <li>Rightfully a classic; not so self-helpy as you'd think.</li>
            <li>Quoted on p. 75: "Whenever you go out of doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp."</li>
            <li>Fundamentally people want a sense of importance. "William James said: 'The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.'"</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>The Imperfectionists</strong>, Tom Rachman.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A great read, and devastating.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Both Flesh and Not: Essays</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
          <li><strong>Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
          <li><strong>The Giver</strong>, Lois Lowry.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I remember liking <em>The Giver</em> when I, along with millions of other American kids, read it in middle school. And I remember liking it because it was cryptic—it gestured at something secretly significant. And that in itself is interesting, because re-reading it now I can see that it <em>isn't</em>, as it turns out, a cryptic book. It's actually pretty straightforward—still great, but no longer glowing with some ineffable magic. What does that mean? Does it mean my mind's gotten stronger, or weaker?</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Stephenson might have the best job in the world. You can see how he uses his novels to dive into subjects that interest him. In that sense he's a lot like a journalist. These projects are an excuse for him to study and talk to smart people and even to do original research over the course of many years. In this book those topics include: orbital mechanics, mining culture, the physics of chains, big space engineering, epigenetics, and glider flight.</li>
        <li>The premise and storyline of this book might be the best Stephenson has ever come up with. The moon blows up in the first sentence; this causes a chain reaction that will, it is calculated, wipe out the planet in two years. The action takes place in three parts; the first and last of these are gripping and fascinating. The last part in particular is fun to read and imaginative. The middle part is a slog, and takes up about ten times too many pages. One consequence of Stephenson being (it seems) a scholar first and a storyteller second is that he indulges in technical detail. When he's describing new worlds, and the story is moving fast (as in the third section), that's welcome—but when the going is slow, all the minutiae is painful.</li>

      <li><strong>The Beautiful and Damned</strong>, F. Scott Fitzgerald</li>
      <li><strong>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work</strong>, Alain de Botton</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An unusual little book that ought to be read widely. It's a generous, funny, thoughtful look at the work that we do now—in logistics, in back offices, in science and infrastructure engineering—and what that means.</li>
        <li>The chapter on painting was my favorite.</li>
        <li>de Botton has a roving, essaying style sort of like DFW's in his nonfiction—he goes places and meets strangers, like a reporter, but instead of merely reporting he shows you what's going on inside his head. It makes for a more entertaining read, and it feels more honest.</li>

      <li><strong>The Stand</strong>, Stephen King</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Maybe the most gripping novel I've read. The characters and scenes are incredibly vivid—King writes in a way where you <em>see</em> everything that's happening. And it's hard to imagine a more compelling premise and plot. The characters felt alive.</li>
        <li>This will be my go-to recommendation to anyone looking for a fun, engaging read. The perfect beach or subway book.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Pale Fire</strong>, Vladimir Nabokov</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I believe Kinbote is the author of Canto IV.</li>
        <li>The poem itself is, I think, a great work of literature, and it's a stroke of genius to have embedded it in this strange novel, first because it must have greatly multiplied the poem's audience, and second because it has a way of weakening your critical stance toward it—you don't go into it thinking, "Here's a poem I must criticize," but thinking rather, "Oh, how neat—a little poem."</li>

        <ul>
          <li>What a book! Required reading, and especially so for high schoolers and college students. I wasn't much interested in bio as a student but now am hungry to learn more about it, and sort of wish I'd fallen down the rabbit-hole when I was in school. This book would have been a great way in.</li>
          <li>I first heard about it via <a href="http://www.righto.com/2011/07/cells-are-very-fast-and-crowded-places.html">this blog post</a> about how cells are "very fast and crowded places." Indeed, in the first few chapters of the book, this model of the inside of a cell is articulated very clearly.
          <p>I'd always wondered what it meant for genes to be "expressed" and <em>when</em> exactly this would happen, how long it would go on, how often it would be repeated. This book gave me a mental model of the cell that explains gene expression in a simple way: our transcription machinery, like all proteins in the cell, are bouncing around at random, very quickly, encountering other molecules to bind with (or not); when they encounter DNA, they transcribe ("express") it. Gene expression is modulated—genes are "turned off" or on—when the DNA encoding that gene is literally hidden from the transcription machinery, by being packed into the crevasses of tight chromatin bundles.</p></li>

	  <li>Wow! An incredibly captivating read. And complements the movie: both were ideal versions of the story for their form. Here in the book you get lots more motivation and justification—it's very technical to the point of seeming real.</li>
	  <li>Makes me want Crichton's job: study a world of science or engineering in great depth, and as payment, produce page-turning fiction about it.</li>
	  <li>Did you know that at one point, Chrichton <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/michael-crichton-reign-over-pop-culture-jurassic-park-westworld">had</a> the nation's #1 bestselling book, the top movie at the box office, and the most-watched television series, <em>all at the same time</em>—and that this happened TWICE (!)?</li>

	  <li>My friend Ben and I wrote a New York Times crossword puzzle, which appeared in print on Saturday, October 20th 2018. You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/svc/crosswords/v2/puzzle/print/Oct2018.pdf">download it here if you're an NYT subscriber</a>.</li>
          <li>I <a href="features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs">reverse-engineered Google Docs</a> to create <a href="http://draftback.com">Draftback</a>, a tool which allows you to play back any Google Doc's history as though it were a movie. (<a href="http://draftback.com/documents/1fFdqVj7XnBBcKyytm8u8mqMtPInv10ntP79uHICfGVQ">See an example here</a>, from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/watch-me-write-this-article/">FiveThirtyEight article</a> about the tool.) It has more than 300,000 users, most of them teachers and students. Here's a note about how it's being used in the classroom, from <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/draftback-to-the-future-a-tool-for-writing-process-analysis/">the <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em></a>.</li>
          <li>My friend Ben and I made a typewriter that sends its keystrokes in real time to a Google Doc. We call it <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/docwriter">the DocWriter</a>.</li>
          <li>I created a tool for reporters that syncs notes to a recording, and generates a <a href="http://jsomers.net/call">timecoded transcript</a>.</li>
          <li>I've made a very simple typewriter simulator (a text editor where you can't hit Delete) at <a href="http://jsomers.net/typewriter">jsomers.net/typerwriter</a>.</li>
					<li>As discussed in <a href="/blog/directions">this blog post</a>, I tapped into the Google Directions API to answer a few neat questions about driving directions, including "What's the most complicated route in the United States?" The relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/jsomers/directions">here</a>.</li>
					<li>I wrote up my solution to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problem #106 in <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/pe-oeis">this blog post</a>. Here is a more recent <a href="/code/215.html">solution</a>, this time in Ruby, to problem #215. And here's a <a href="/blog/project-euler-problem-191-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-counting-and-love-induction">write-up for problem #191</a>.</li>
					<li>On <a href="/110">this page</a> I wrote some Javascript to quickly generate rows of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110 cellular automaton</a>.</li>

              The opening scene of this article is one of my favorites, as it’s more cinematic than most of what I’ve done. It was a joy to research and write: I got to spend time in Utah and Switzerland as ski patrollers fired artillery at the mountainside and scientists studied snowpack at both massive and microscopic scales. This story happened to come out in the second week of March, 2020, and was as a result hardly read, I think; we all had more important things to worry about. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/snow-science-against-the-avalanche">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              What if the best ideas in artificial intelligence are yellowing in a drawer in Bloomington? Douglas Hofstadter, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gödel, Escher, Bach, thinks we've lost sight of what artificial intelligence really means. In this 7,500-word profile for <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, my first article in print, I follow Hofstadter's stubborn quest to replicate the human mind. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              It turns out that there is huge variation in skill among surgeons, and that this is the biggest factor determining the outcome of many surgical procedures. So which surgeon you get matters—a lot. But how do we know who the good ones are?<br><br>
              In this article, I profile a biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering who is developing a program to give surgeons feedback about their performance. Included are two videos—one of a good surgeon, one of a surgeon who's not so good—that everyone should see.

              <li><a href="/blog/dictionary">You're probably using the wrong dictionary</a>*</li>
              
              Something about this essay <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7772557">struck a nerve</a>—it has been read by more than 130,000 people. It's a lament about the state of today's dictionaries, and an argument in favor of using Noah Webster's 1913 edition (with instructions for how to install it).<br><br><em>I don’t want you to conclude that it’s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster’s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. In fact they’re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm’s length from the actual language.</em><br><br>
 
<em>Recall that the New Oxford, for the word “fustian,” gives “pompous or pretentious speech or writing.” I said earlier that that wasn’t even really correct. Here, then, is Webster’s definition: “An inflated style of writing; a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of the thoughts or subject; bombast.” Do you see the difference? What makes fustian fustian is not just that the language is pompous—it’s that this pomposity is above the dignity of the thoughts or subject. It’s using fancy language where fancy language isn’t called for. It’s a subtle difference, but that’s the whole point: English is an awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it’s worse than useless. It’s misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their worth and purpose.</em></div>

				<h2>Books</h2>
				<p class="narrowish">This is a list of the books I've read since my first day at college, arranged basically in the order I read them. I have the list both to jog my memory and because I've read a lot of stuff I've loved, and want other people to find it.</p>

				<ul class="booky_list">
					<li><strong>Neuromancer</strong>, William Gibson.</li>
					<li><strong>Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters</strong> and <strong>Seymour: An Introduction
</strong>, J.D. Salinger.
					</li><li><strong>Narcissus and Goldmund</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>What is Thought?</strong>, Eric Baum.</li>
					<li><strong>My Belief: Essays on Life and Art</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>Naomi</strong>, Junichiro Tanizaki.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America"><strong>The U.S. Constitution</strong></a>.
					</li><li><strong>Demian</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>The Mind's I</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter and Dan Dennett.
						<ul>
							<li>A compendium on the philosophy of mind; Hofstadter and Dennett take turns providing commentary for each of the selected essays/stories.</li>
							<li>
								Highlights: 
								<ol>
									<li>"Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which Turing proposes his eponymous test.</li>
									<li>"The Turing Test: A Coffeehouse Conversation."</li>
									<li>"Minds, Brains, and Programs" (especially Hofstadter's response).</li>
									<li>Thomas Nagel's classic, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"</li>
								</ol>
							</li>	
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Permutation City</strong>, Greg Egan.</li>
					<li><strong>The Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa</strong>, Yukichi Fukuzawa.
					</li><li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2775/2775-h/2775-h.htm"><strong>The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion</strong></a>, Ford Madox Ford.</li>
					<li><strong>The Iliad</strong>, Homer.
					</li><li><strong>Freedom and Neurobiology: Reflections on Free Language Will, and Political Power</strong>, John Searle.
					</li><li><strong>I Am a Strange Loop</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.
						<ul>
							<li>A "softer" and less satisfying version of much of Hofstadter's earlier writing. It may be a good introduction to his ideas for people who don't have time for <em>GEB</em> or find it too technical.</li>
							<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter/dp/0465030785">best pages</a> of this book (from the first chapter) are available in Amazon's "Look Inside" reader.</li>
						</ul>
					</li><li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html"><strong>The Waste Land</strong></a>, T.S. Eliot</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The link above points to the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">raw text online</a> but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Land-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393974995">this print edition</a> has tons of excellent annotations, commentary, and criticism, which are pretty much necessary for a poem this difficult.</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</strong>, Richard P. Feynman</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I have written about Feynman <a href="/blog/feynmans-rigor">here</a>. See this wonderful series of videos, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pYRn5j7oI&amp;feature=related">Fun to Imagine</a>," in which he explains (a) why mirrors seem to reverse left-and-right but not up-and-down, (b) how trains stay on the tracks, and (c) how rubber bands work. Fantastic stuff.</li>
						<li>Other Feynman videos worth watching: <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3164300309410618119#">The Last Journey of a Genius</a>, about his adventure to Tannu Tuva. Warning: a real tear-jerker. Also, of course, <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8777381378502286852#">The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</a>.</li>
						<li>Here's a <a href="http://www.longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/">great short piece</a> on Feynman's involvement with a massively-parallel supercomputer known as "The Connection Machine."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The God Delusion</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.daoisopen.com/ZhuangziTranslation.html"><strong>Zhuangzi</strong></a>, Zhuangzi.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/"><strong>The Elements of Style</strong></a>, William Strunk Jr. and White, E.B.
					<ul>
						<li>This is a classic and is full of excellent advice about style. But it is dangerous, overly prescriptive, and in many places wrong; <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog%2F+strunk+white&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;oq=&amp;fp=6ffc3260debcd3">do a site search</a> on one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">The Language Log</a>, to see all of their carefully argued (and vehement) criticism.</li>
						<li>Also read George Orwell's "<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language.</a>"</li>
					</ul>
					</li><li><strong>The Selfish Gene</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><strong>Lost in the Funhouse</strong>, John Barth.</li>
					<li><strong>Three Lives</strong>, Gertrude Stein.</li>
					<li><strong>Siddhartha</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass,_and_What_Alice_Found_There"><strong>Through the Looking Glass</strong></a>, Lewis Carroll.</li>
					<li><strong>The Analects</strong>, Confucius.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"To learn, and at due times to repeat what one has learnt — is that not after all a pleasure?"</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>To the Lighthouse</strong>, Virginia Woolf</li>
					<li><strong>The Animal Mind</strong>, James L. Gould.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This was heavily cited in Eric Baum's <strong>What is Thought?</strong>, and with good reason: it's full of impressive displays of animal intelligence.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A strange and problematic thesis, but fascinating nonetheless. There is a wonderful line in here where at "odd, unpredictable" moments Dyson found himself "wondering whether trees could think. Not thinking the way we think, but thinking the way trees think; say, two or three hundred years to form the slow trace of an idea."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cosmopolis: The Hidden Agenda of Modernity</strong>, Stephen Toulmin.
					</li><li><strong>Narrative Thought and Narrative Language</strong>, Bruce K. Britton and Anthony D. Pelligrini (eds.).
					</li><li><strong>Life: What a Concept!</strong>, Freeman Dyson, J. Craig Venter, George Church, Robert Shapiro, Dimitar Sasselov, and Seth Lloyd.</li>
					<li><strong>Evariste Galois</strong>, Laura Rigatelli Toti.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">his Wikipedia page</a> — what an exciting and romantic life. I'd like to write a screenplay about it someday.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Art of War</strong>, Sun Tzu.
					</li><li><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</strong>, James Joyce.
					</li><li><strong>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<li><strong>Thus Spake Zarathustra</strong>, Friedrich Nietzsche.
					</li><li><strong>Comeuppance: Costly Altruistic Signaling Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction</strong>, William Flesch.
					</li><li><strong>Franny and Zooey</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<li><strong>Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment</strong>, Richard E. Nisbett and Lee Ross.
					</li><li><strong>Cat's Cradle</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.
					</li><li><strong>Welcome to the Monkey House</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorite collection of Vonnegut stories. What a crisp, straightforward writer, and a brilliant storyteller. He never wastes your time.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Metamagical Themas</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Another compendium from Hofstadter — a collection of all of his <em>Scientific American</em> columns. "Metamagical Themas" is remarkably an anagram of "Mathematical Games," the title of his predecessor Martin Gardner's column (on recreational mathematics). Crazy!</li> 
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</strong>, Timothy Gowers.
					</li><li><strong>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity</strong>, John H. Holland</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I had Holland as a professor at the U of M. He was brilliant, and an excellent teacher. I also recommend his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Chaos-Order-Helix-Books/dp/0738201421"><strong>Emergence: From Chaos To Order</strong></a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A Mathematician's Apology</strong>, G. H. Hardy.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is as good as everyone says it is. Hardy was mostly famous for two things: this book, and discovering the true genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Ramanujan</a>. Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Knew-Infinity-Ramanujan/dp/0671750615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287514463&amp;sr=1-1">a biography</a> of <em>him</em>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A People's History of the United States</strong>, Howard Zinn.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Like Will Hunting says, this one will blow your hair back.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Big Lebowski: The Making of a Coen Brothers Film</strong>, Tricia Cooke and William Preston Robertson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shows the Coen brothers' obsessive attention to detail. Every shot is storyboarded, and every piece of the production — wardrobes, lighting, casting, etc. — is meticulously planned. They're the Joyce of filmmaking.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</strong>, Thomas S. Kuhn</li>
					<li><strong>Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe</strong>, Michel Foucault.</li>
					<li><strong>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of my favorite short fiction is in here. See, e.g., <a href="/bi-20.html">this</a> and <a href="/bi-48.html">this</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Breaking The Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon</strong>, Daniel Dennett.</li>
					<li><strong>Dialogues with Children</strong>, Gareth Mathews.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Proof that children can do philosophy, and a study of an excellent teacher in action.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Remarks on Color</strong>, Ludwig Wittgenstein.
					</li><li><strong>Tao Te Ching</strong>, Laozi.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Drastically overrated.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Diamond Age</strong>, Neal Stephenson.
					</li><li><strong>Hamlet</strong>, William Shakespeare.</li>
					<li><strong>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</strong>, Edward Tufte.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worthwhile even if all you learn is to maximize his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte#Information_design">"data-ink" ratio</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science</strong>, Atul Gawande.</li>
					<li><strong>Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind</strong>, V. S. Ramachandran.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of the coolest — i.e., the most fascinating — stuff I've ever read. This book may tempt you to drop everything for a career in neurology or cognitive neuroscience.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Dubliners</strong>, James Joyce.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My professor called <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/958/">"The Dead"</a> the best short story of all time. "Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Autobiography of Malcolm X</strong>, Malcolm X with Alex Haley.
					</li><li><strong>Nine Stories</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of these stories took Salinger more than a year to write, each. It paid off — they're incredible. Gems.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</strong>, Richard P. Feynman.</li>
					<li><strong>1000 Most Important Words</strong>, Norman W. Schur.</li>
					<li><strong>The Hedgehog and the Fox</strong>, Isaiah Berlin.
					</li><li><strong>Ulysses</strong>, James Joyce.</li>
					<li><strong>Writing in Unreaderly Times</strong>, Kevin Smokler.</li>
					<li><strong>Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service</strong>, Ari Weinzweig.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://zingermans.com">Zingerman's</a>, in Ann Arbor, MI, is arguably the best (and <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030101/25036.html">best-run</a>) deli outside of New York. And part of what makes it so special is their <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/983-good-company-zingermans">highly regarded</a> company culture and especially the way they treat customers. This book is a great guide for doing that yourself, as most of the ideas and advice are less about the restaurant industry than the giving-people-what-they-want industry.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>On Bullshit</strong>, Harry G. Frankfurt.</li>
					<li><strong>I Want to Be a Mathematician</strong>, Paul R. Halmos</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What an incredible book — I will have it by my bedside wherever I live.</li>
						<li>Halmos was a beautiful writer and a hard worker. Here's what he had to say on the subject:
							<blockquote>Archimedes taught us that a small quantity added to itself often enough becomes a large quantity (or, in proverbial terms, every little bit helps). When it comes to accomplishing the bulk of the world's work, and, in particular, when it comes to writing a book, I believe that the converse of Archimedes' teaching is also true: the only way to write a large book is to keep writing a small bit of it, steadily every day, with no exception, with no holiday.</blockquote>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>Snow Crash</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>Godel's Proof</strong>, Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It's hard to overstate the importance of what Godel achieved. Nagel and Newman do a superb job of explaining his remarkably clever and loopy proof, a proof which inspired Hofstadter to write the incomparable <strong>Godel, Escher, Bach</strong>. In fact, this is one of Hofstadter's favorite books.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Winesburg, Ohio</strong>, Sherwood Anderson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A study of "grotesques." As some writer says in the afterword, it has a lot to teach us about humility, ambivalence, and self-doubt.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Equation that Couldn't Be Solved</strong>, Mario Livio.</li>
					<li><strong>The Vagina Monologues</strong>, Eve Ensler.</li>
					<li><strong>Anathem</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>A Man Without a Country</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<li><strong>Systemantics</strong>, John Gall.</li>
					<li><strong>The Dip</strong>, Seth Godin.</li>
					<li><strong>Fear and Trembling</strong>, Soren Kierkegaard.</li>
					<li><strong>Mythologies</strong>, Roland Barthes.</li>
					<li><strong>The Stranger</strong>, Albert Camus.</li>
					<li><strong>Getting to Maybe: How to Excel on Law School Exams</strong>, Richard Michael Fischl and Jeremy Paul.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I wrote about this a bit in <a href="/blog/why-the-law">my piece</a>, "Why the Law"</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Proof</strong>, David Auburn.</li>
					<li><strong>Coders at Work</strong>, Peter Seibel.</li>
					<li><strong>Unaccustomed Earth</strong>, Jhumpa Lahiri.</li>
					<li><strong>Six Easy Pieces</strong>, Richard Feynman.</li>
					<li><strong>Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings from a Lifetime in Golf</strong>, Harvey Penick.</li>
					<li><strong>Lolita</strong>, Vladimir Nabokov.</li>
					<li><strong>How Fiction Works</strong>, James Wood.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I recommend this to any amateur reader (or writer) of fiction. It gives you a great toolbox for thinking about the craft — and it'll make you a better reader.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>This Craft of Verse</strong>, Jorge Luis Borges.</li>
					<li><strong>Envisioning Information</strong>, Edward Tufte.</li>
					<li><strong>The Nine</strong>, Jeffrey Toobin.</li>
					<li><strong>Girl With Curious Hair</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<li><strong>The Best of Isaac Asimov</strong>, Isaac Asimov.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorite stories, in order, were "<a href="http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html">The Last Question</a>," "<a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/HON114/Nightfall.htm">Nightfall</a>," and "Billiard Ball."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Art and Craft of Judging: the Decisions of Judge Learned Hand</strong>, Hershel Shanks.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Fantastic. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_Hand">Learned Hand</a> was a beautiful expositor, and a crystal-clear thinker. One of the great minds of his century.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Junk Mail</strong>, Will Self.</li>
					<li><strong>Tinkers</strong>, Paul Harding.</li>
					<li><strong>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</strong>, Richard Feynman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Self-recommending. Read it with an eye toward Feynman's disposition, his particular way of thinking — concretely, simply, with a hard reflex against the <em>illusion</em> of understanding.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Human Stain</strong>, Philip Roth.</li>
					<li><strong>Gang Leader for a Day</strong>, Sudhir Venkatesh.</li>
					<li><strong>Story of My Life</strong>, Jay McInerney.</li>
					<li><strong>The Road</strong>, Cormac McCarthy.</li>
					<li><strong>Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgement</strong>, Allan Gibbard.</li>
					<li><strong>Zen Flesh, Zen Bones</strong>, Paul Reps and Nyogen Senzaki, eds.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Disappointing except for "Centering", which was excellent.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Inside "Jeopardy!": What Really Goes on at TV's Top Quiz Show</strong>, Harry Eisenberg.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There is lots of interesting info about how the show works: how clues are written, researched, vetted, etc., and how individual episodes are produced.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Chomsky-Foucault Debate on Human Nature</strong>, Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault, ed. John Rajchman.</li>
					<li><strong>A Mathematician's Lament: How School Cheats Us Out of Our Most Fascinating and Imaginative Art Form</strong>, Paul Lockhart.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The expanded book version of <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:qcqr-s07yTgJ:www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf+mathematician's+lament&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShtuWAC3pVdpPkCH-J-sRac3MAPc9S-NY4fSzssyuaD8rnZtvotVHKuQRvzhrvT_lfVMUW81NcYWaGkgZbk1bNUKNFmJ2UuhJPsN6vob3nSy23XoAaVUTnwq0b-GTssPJx7Mrwv&amp;sig=AHIEtbS2U273ZekpfeQf0t-taW6Mbzegkg">this wonderful essay</a> on mathematics education.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Look at the Birdie</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<li><strong>The Catcher in the Rye</strong>, J. D. Salinger.</li>
					<li><strong>Dune</strong>, Frank Herbert.</li>
					<li><strong>Wampeters, Foma &amp; Granfalloons (Opinions)</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I particularly liked "Science Fiction", "Excelsior! We're Going to the Moon! Excelsior!", "Why They Read Hesse", "Biafra: A People Betrayed", "Address to Graduating Class at Bennington College, 1970", "Address to the National Institute of Arts And Letters, 1971", "Reflections on My Own Death", "Address at Rededication of Wheaton College Library, 1973", and "Playboy Interview".</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Little Schemer</strong>, Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book. From essentially nothing, it builds you up to the point where you can write (or at least understand) (a) the applicative-order fixed point combinator for functionals, and (b) an interpreter for the very language you're writing in.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/derivation-of-ycombinator">a readable derivation of the Y combinator</a> based on the one given in the book.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps">a more compact attempt</a>, by Paul Graham, to build a Lisp interpreter from the ground up.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem</strong>, ed. Jonathan Shear.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of papers responding to David Chalmers's "<a href="http://consc.net/papers/facing.html">Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness</a>," in which he famously introduces the term "the hard problem." The hard problem is the problem of explaining how first-person phenomenal experiences—colors, tastes, itches, pains, thoughts, moods, mental images, feels, etc.—arise in the brain, which looks to be nothing more than a really complicated collection of jiggling atoms, just like everything else in our physical world.</li>
						<li>A good portion of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=t4KNDxsj7fcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=site:books.google.com+explaining+consciousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o1jQhAg96G&amp;sig=H0Qi6UQuCPAkVPfMtwI-y_d6e3c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hCbhTN6hL4L48AaWjbm7Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">the book</a> is available online at Google Books. Since it's just a collection of papers, it should be easy enough to find whatever you need.</li>
						<li>Chalmers's <a href="http://consc.net/papers/moving.html">response</a> to the responses might be a good way of getting a lay of the land without having to trudge through 400 pages of detailed arguments.</li>
						<li>If anything the book chipped away at my staunch materialism. I feel a lot more open to Chalmers's view, which initially struck me as almost laughably absurd. The hard problem is so hard, I now think, that it warrants quite drastic moves, like introducing something fundamental to the ontology of the world.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Armageddon in Retrospect</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of his writings on war, both fiction and nonfiction. Quite good.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Communication With Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), Proceedings of a conference held at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory, Yerevan, USSR, 5-11 September 1971</strong>, edited by Carl Sagan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>One of maybe two or three of the most interesting books I've read.</li>
						<li>The chief aims of the conference were, first, to estimate values for terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#The_equation">Drake equation</a>, and second, to devise strategies for contact. Necessarily, then, they had to discuss a remarkable range of topics—everything from the chemical origins of life, to the anthropology of early civilizations, to the problem of encoding messages in a form comprehensible to intelligences vastly unlike ourselves.</li>
						<li>The conferencegoers were some of the top scientists from around the	world, chiefly the US and USSR. And if anything the pleasure here is in watching them think and debate in a relatively informal setting. It's a wonderful mix of prepared talks and extemporaneous discussion.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</strong>, Paul Hoffman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book about a wonderful man. Captivating, fast, and fun. Erdős was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived, publishing 1,475 papers, many of them hugely important.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Honeybee Democracy</strong>, Thomas D. Seeley.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>First, Seeley explains in wonderfully lucid detail just how bees go about finding their new homes (nest sites). I came away feeling like an expert on the subject—no doubt a testament to Seeley's expository skill. Second, the illustrations are fantastic: Edward Tufte would be proud. Finally, this serves nicely as a case study in basic science: how to explore, how to ask useful questions, how to design experiments, how to patiently collect data, how to make sense of your results, and how to tell a coherent story about them.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms</strong>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Provocative, in both good and bad ways.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cryptonomicon</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Easily one of my favorite books. This is actually the second time I've read it—the first was in high school, and unfortunately I think much of it went over my head (though it probably influenced me in all kinds of subtle ways). It's a book that repays many returns.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>For a Breath I Tarry</strong>, Roger Zelazny.</li>
					<li><strong>How Animals Work</strong>, Knut Schmidt-Nielsen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There is a surprising and fascinating detail every five pages or so. It gets a bit technical, but the writing is remarkably understated and lucid.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>How the Mind Works</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>And Then We Came to the End</strong>, Joshua Ferris.</li>
					<li><strong>Palindromes and Anagrams</strong>, Howard W. Bergerson.</li>
					<li><strong>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Langauge</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quintessential Hofstadter.</li>
						<li>The index for this book apparently took Hofstadter one full month of fifteen-hour days to pull off, which, when you see it, seems like not nearly enough time!</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Yours Ever: People and Their Letters</strong>, Thomas Mallon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mallon is an excellent editor, writer, and reader, and a wonderful tour guide through centuries of private lives.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</strong>, Keith Johnstone.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Protagoras"><strong>Protagoras</strong></a>, Plato.</li>
					<li><strong>One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science</strong>, George Gamow.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is a book that should be printed in massive quantities and sprinkled everyplace youngsters hang out, in the hope that just a few of them pick it up and delightedly fall headfirst into a life of science.</li>
						<li>Deserving of all its praise (see for example the distribution of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Two-Three-Infinity-Speculations/product-reviews/0486256642/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">reviews on Amazon</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Screwtape Letters</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Incisive chronicle of the many ways humans stray from the good life. Lewis is a master observer of subtly pernicious psychology.</li>
						<li>Amusing, witty, and wise, just like most of Lewis's stuff.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Martian Chronicles</strong>, Ray Bradbury.</li>
					<li><strong>Star Maker</strong>, Olaf Stapledon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Wildly imaginative but maybe too abstract, lacking the standard hooks of successful speculative fiction (like characters, or detailed close-ups of the worlds).</li>
						<li>Stellar prose. It's florid but not purple and laced with an almost biblical majesty.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor</strong>, Paul Farmer.</li>
					<li><strong>Mere Christianity</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<li><strong>C. S. Lewis's Lost Aeneid</strong>, C. S. Lewis, ed. A. T. Reynes.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Lewis is a wonderful translator.</li>
						<li>Only books one, two, and six are translated at any length, enough to show that the Aeneid is a hell of a story.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The John McPhee Reader</strong>, John McPhee, ed. William L. Howarth.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>When I grow up, what would I like to be? A modified John McPhee!</li>
						<li>It's hard to overstate how much I admire McPhee's work and writing. He's a master craftsman. Howarth's introduction tells and the rest of the book shows.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Let the Great World Spin</strong>, Colum McCann.</li>
					<li><strong>Maximum City</strong>, Suketu Mehta.</li>
					<li><strong>Field Notes on Science and Nature</strong>, ed. Michael R. Canfield.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A beautiful, readable, very <em>useful</em> book.</li>
						<li>One is quickly sold on the power of narratives and sketches, and notes in general, for recording information, remembering stuff, and most important, propelling the mind into a reflective observant mode.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Zodiac</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>The Best American Essays (2010)</strong>, ed. Christopher Hitchens.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorites were "Gyromancy," "The Elegant Eyeball," "On John Updike," "Irreconcilable Dissonance," "The Dead Book," and "My Genome, My Self," in that order.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements</strong>, Nils J. Nilsson.</li>
					<li><strong>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: The Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Beatrice and Virgil</strong>, Yann Martel.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very quick read, and very suspenseful. You're drawn through the book on your tiptoes. But I kept waiting for the story to gear up in earnest, and kept waiting, until I had only a slim fingerful of pages left and nothing meaty yet had happened. I was left unsatisfied.</li>
						<li>"Unsatisfied," I say, except that the last few pages, particularly the short "games"... they're incredible.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Angels and Ages: A Short Book About Darwin, Lincoln, and Modern Life</strong>, Adam Gopnik.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Way, way better than you probably think it's going to be. Gopnik is a brilliant essayist.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>REAMDE</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Stephenson is a very indulgent writer. A friend at work said he was like an investigative journalist of his own imagination. When a character plugs in a router, it's 500 words about router configuration; when someone has to pick a lock, it's an essay on lock-picking and hacker culture; anytime a gun goes off it's a very careful description of bolts and safeties and the heft of the thing and firing mechanisms; when the plot calls for a flight across the Pacific it's a whole chapter's worth of great circle routes and the "what it's like" of bizjet travel. All very accurate. This is why I mostly like reading his stuff, because you <em>learn</em> so much in a tasty plot package.</li>
						<li>If I like <em>REAMDE</em> less than some of his other books, though, it's because the stuff he ends up teaching here is not as super interesting as the stuff, say, in <em>Cryptonomicon</em> or <em>The Diamond Age</em>. (I feel like I'd be much better at paintball after reading this book; in fact I was watching Die Hard 2 not too long after and the whole time I was thinking of how pathetically thoughtless all the maneuvers and tactics were in that movie, as compared to what I'd "seen" in Stephenson's book.)</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Sparse Distributed Memory</strong>, Pentti Kanerva.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A coherent high-level account of how memory might work. Neurons are attractors in a space of bitstrings, which code for on/off features in the world. Bitstrings address neurons, which store addresses to other neurons; the chain either diverges (no recall) or converges to the best match.</li>
						<li>The mathematics of the space {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> ensure, first, that any two points chosen at random are far apart, but always closely connectable by a third; and second—for that reason—that a sparse and manageably-sized collection of address decoders (neurons) is sufficient to solve the best-match problem when N is massive (~10,000).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Q.E.D: Beauty in Mathematical Proof</strong>, Burkard Polster.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very short book with beautiful illustrations of elegant proofs.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</strong>, Jon Gertner.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worth reading just for its account of the invention of the transistor. Great material, too, on Claude Shannon.</li>
						<li>Includes a very interesting concluding chapter that tries to explain what made Bell Labs so successful, and where we might find something similar today. Is it Silicon Valley? (No.) Gertner wrote a summary of that argument for the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=all">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry</strong>, Jon Ronson.</li>
					<li><strong>Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche</strong>, Haruki Murakami.</li>
					<li><strong>My First Summer in the Sierra</strong>, John Muir.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What I would give to have one day of Muir's summer, or better yet, one small ounce of his happy attitude.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Lady in the Looking-Glass</strong>, Virginia Woolf.</li>
					<li><strong>The Way of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism</strong>, Martin Buber.</li>
					<li><strong>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</strong>, Douglas Adams.</li>
					<li><strong>Final Approach: The Crash of Eastern 212</strong>, William Stockton.</li>
					<li><strong>The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups</strong>, Randall Stross.</li>
					<li><strong>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</strong>, Bernard Suits.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The editorial review summarizes well: "In the mid twentieth century the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously asserted that games are indefinable; there are no common threads that link them all. 'Nonsense,' says the sensible Bernard Suits: 'playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.' The short book Suits wrote demonstrating precisely that is as playful as it is insightful, as stimulating as it is delightful."</li>
						<li>This book is a shining example of philosophical thinking, of intellectual integrity: it articulates in the best possible light the best objections to its thesis, "come what may." That it manages convincingly to knock them all down is just icing. And in style: it's been a long while since I've read writing this clear, and yet it's not overbearing—it manages to be both precise and light.</li>
						<li>Another one of those special books that I read on a whim and that will, I fear, never be read by anyone I recommend it to.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cloud Atlas</strong>, David Mitchell.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>As good as everyone says. Mitchell is an unbelievable prose stylist.</li>
						<li>My favorite was the long chapter that spanned the middle of the book. I preferred the second halves of the stories more often than the first halves; I particularly enjoyed the second half of the Frobisher letters.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</strong>, Robin Sloan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quick, unserious, but very engrossing. A joy to read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Corrections</strong>, Jonathan Franzen.</li>
					<li><strong>How to Win Friends and Influence People</strong>, Dale Carnegie.</li>
					<ul>
            <li>Rightfully a classic; not so self-helpy as you'd think.</li>
            <li>Quoted on p. 75: "Whenever you go out of doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp."</li>
            <li>Fundamentally people want a sense of importance. "William James said: 'The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.'"</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>The Imperfectionists</strong>, Tom Rachman.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A great read, and devastating.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Both Flesh and Not: Essays</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
          <li><strong>Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
          <li><strong>The Giver</strong>, Lois Lowry.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I remember liking <em>The Giver</em> when I, along with millions of other American kids, read it in middle school. And I remember liking it because it was cryptic—it gestured at something secretly significant. And that in itself is interesting, because re-reading it now I can see that it <em>isn't</em>, as it turns out, a cryptic book. It's actually pretty straightforward—still great, but no longer glowing with some ineffable magic. What does that mean? Does it mean my mind's gotten stronger, or weaker?</li>

      <li><strong>Seveneves</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Stephenson might have the best job in the world. You can see how he uses his novels to dive into subjects that interest him. In that sense he's a lot like a journalist. These projects are an excuse for him to study and talk to smart people and even to do original research over the course of many years. In this book those topics include: orbital mechanics, mining culture, the physics of chains, big space engineering, epigenetics, and glider flight.</li>
        <li>The premise and storyline of this book might be the best Stephenson has ever come up with. The moon blows up in the first sentence; this causes a chain reaction that will, it is calculated, wipe out the planet in two years. The action takes place in three parts; the first and last of these are gripping and fascinating. The last part in particular is fun to read and imaginative. The middle part is a slog, and takes up about ten times too many pages. One consequence of Stephenson being (it seems) a scholar first and a storyteller second is that he indulges in technical detail. When he's describing new worlds, and the story is moving fast (as in the third section), that's welcome—but when the going is slow, all the minutiae is painful.</li>

      <li><strong>The Beautiful and Damned</strong>, F. Scott Fitzgerald</li>
      <li><strong>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work</strong>, Alain de Botton</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An unusual little book that ought to be read widely. It's a generous, funny, thoughtful look at the work that we do now—in logistics, in back offices, in science and infrastructure engineering—and what that means.</li>
        <li>The chapter on painting was my favorite.</li>
        <li>de Botton has a roving, essaying style sort of like DFW's in his nonfiction—he goes places and meets strangers, like a reporter, but instead of merely reporting he shows you what's going on inside his head. It makes for a more entertaining read, and it feels more honest.</li>

      <li><strong>Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis</strong>, Robert F. Kennedy</li>
      <li><strong>The Stand</strong>, Stephen King</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Maybe the most gripping novel I've read. The characters and scenes are incredibly vivid—King writes in a way where you <em>see</em> everything that's happening. And it's hard to imagine a more compelling premise and plot. The characters felt alive.</li>
        <li>This will be my go-to recommendation to anyone looking for a fun, engaging read. The perfect beach or subway book.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Pale Fire</strong>, Vladimir Nabokov</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I believe Kinbote is the author of Canto IV.</li>
        <li>The poem itself is, I think, a great work of literature, and it's a stroke of genius to have embedded it in this strange novel, first because it must have greatly multiplied the poem's audience, and second because it has a way of weakening your critical stance toward it—you don't go into it thinking, "Here's a poem I must criticize," but thinking rather, "Oh, how neat—a little poem."</li>

        <ul>
          <li>What a book! Required reading, and especially so for high schoolers and college students. I wasn't much interested in bio as a student but now am hungry to learn more about it, and sort of wish I'd fallen down the rabbit-hole when I was in school. This book would have been a great way in.</li>
          <li>I first heard about it via <a href="http://www.righto.com/2011/07/cells-are-very-fast-and-crowded-places.html">this blog post</a> about how cells are "very fast and crowded places." Indeed, in the first few chapters of the book, this model of the inside of a cell is articulated very clearly.
          <p>I'd always wondered what it meant for genes to be "expressed" and <em>when</em> exactly this would happen, how long it would go on, how often it would be repeated. This book gave me a mental model of the cell that explains gene expression in a simple way: our transcription machinery, like all proteins in the cell, are bouncing around at random, very quickly, encountering other molecules to bind with (or not); when they encounter DNA, they transcribe ("express") it. Gene expression is modulated—genes are "turned off" or on—when the DNA encoding that gene is literally hidden from the transcription machinery, by being packed into the crevasses of tight chromatin bundles.</p></li>
          <li>There are lots of drawings by Goodsell, along with videos, explanations, and other stuff, at the <a href="http://pdb101.rcsb.org/">protein data bank</a>.</li>
          <li>There are some excerpts on <a href="/machinery-of-life.html">this page</a>.</li>

        <li><strong>I, Claudius</strong>, Robert Graves</li>
        <li><strong>Sex and the City</strong>, Candace Bushnell</li>
        <li><strong>Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th-century Admiral Turned Science into Poetry</strong>, Scott Huler</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A surprisingly wonderful book whose basic point is to pay closer attention to the world around you—a bit like <i>Field Notes on Science and Nature</i>.</li>
          <li>I was inspired to write my own <a href="/beaufort-turbulence.html">Beaufortian scale for airplane turbulence</a>.</li>
        </ul>
	<li><strong>My Brilliant Friend</strong>, Elena Ferrante.</li>
	<li><strong>11/22/63</strong>, Stephen King.</li>
	<li><strong>Sing, Unburied, Sing</strong>, Jesmyn Ward.</li>
	<li><strong>Jurassic Park</strong>, Michael Crichton.</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Wow! An incredibly captivating read. And complements the movie: both were ideal versions of the story for their form. Here in the book you get lots more motivation and justification—it's very technical to the point of seeming real.</li>
	  <li>Makes me want Crichton's job: study a world of science or engineering in great depth, and as payment, produce page-turning fiction about it.</li>
	  <li>Did you know that at one point, Chrichton <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/michael-crichton-reign-over-pop-culture-jurassic-park-westworld">had</a> the nation's #1 bestselling book, the top movie at the box office, and the most-watched television series, <em>all at the same time</em>—and that this happened TWICE (!)?</li>

	  <li>My friend Ben and I wrote a New York Times crossword puzzle, which appeared in print on Saturday, October 20th 2018. You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/svc/crosswords/v2/puzzle/print/Oct2018.pdf">download it here if you're an NYT subscriber</a>.</li>
          <li>I <a href="features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs">reverse-engineered Google Docs</a> to create <a href="http://draftback.com">Draftback</a>, a tool which allows you to play back any Google Doc's history as though it were a movie. (<a href="http://draftback.com/documents/1fFdqVj7XnBBcKyytm8u8mqMtPInv10ntP79uHICfGVQ">See an example here</a>, from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/watch-me-write-this-article/">FiveThirtyEight article</a> about the tool.) It has more than 300,000 users, most of them teachers and students. Here's a note about how it's being used in the classroom, from <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/draftback-to-the-future-a-tool-for-writing-process-analysis/">the <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em></a>.</li>
          <li>My friend Ben and I made a typewriter that sends its keystrokes in real time to a Google Doc. We call it <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/docwriter">the DocWriter</a>.</li>
          <li>I created a tool for reporters that syncs notes to a recording, and generates a <a href="http://jsomers.net/call">timecoded transcript</a>.</li>
          <li>I've made a very simple typewriter simulator (a text editor where you can't hit Delete) at <a href="http://jsomers.net/typewriter">jsomers.net/typerwriter</a>.</li>
					<li>As discussed in <a href="/blog/directions">this blog post</a>, I tapped into the Google Directions API to answer a few neat questions about driving directions, including "What's the most complicated route in the United States?" The relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/jsomers/directions">here</a>.</li>
					<li>I wrote up my solution to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problem #106 in <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/pe-oeis">this blog post</a>. Here is a more recent <a href="/code/215.html">solution</a>, this time in Ruby, to problem #215. And here's a <a href="/blog/project-euler-problem-191-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-counting-and-love-induction">write-up for problem #191</a>.</li>
					<li>On <a href="/110">this page</a> I wrote some Javascript to quickly generate rows of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110 cellular automaton</a>.</li>

              The opening scene of this article is one of my favorites, as it’s more cinematic than most of what I’ve done. It was a joy to research and write: I got to spend time in Utah and Switzerland as ski patrollers fired artillery at the mountainside and scientists studied snowpack at both massive and microscopic scales. This story happened to come out in the second week of March, 2020, and was as a result hardly read, I think; we all had more important things to worry about. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/snow-science-against-the-avalanche">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              A story about the two most senior engineers at Google, Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, who have built much of the company's most important infrastructure—as a pair. For twenty years, they've worked together at a single computer, one of them working the keyboard, the other sitting back, correcting and cajoling like a producer in a news anchor's ear. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

              What if the best ideas in artificial intelligence are yellowing in a drawer in Bloomington? Douglas Hofstadter, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gödel, Escher, Bach, thinks we've lost sight of what artificial intelligence really means. In this 7,500-word profile for <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>, my first article in print, I follow Hofstadter's stubborn quest to replicate the human mind. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-man-who-would-teach-machines-to-think/309529/">(read&nbsp;more)</a></div>

Our destination was Room 328.</em>

              It turns out that there is huge variation in skill among surgeons, and that this is the biggest factor determining the outcome of many surgical procedures. So which surgeon you get matters—a lot. But how do we know who the good ones are?<br><br>
              In this article, I profile a biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering who is developing a program to give surgeons feedback about their performance. Included are two videos—one of a good surgeon, one of a surgeon who's not so good—that everyone should see.

              Something about this essay <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7772557">struck a nerve</a>—it has been read by more than 130,000 people. It's a lament about the state of today's dictionaries, and an argument in favor of using Noah Webster's 1913 edition (with instructions for how to install it).<br><br><em>I don’t want you to conclude that it’s just a matter of aesthetics. Yes, Webster’s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. In fact they’re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep yourself forever at arm’s length from the actual language.</em><br><br>
 
<em>Recall that the New Oxford, for the word “fustian,” gives “pompous or pretentious speech or writing.” I said earlier that that wasn’t even really correct. Here, then, is Webster’s definition: “An inflated style of writing; a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used, above the dignity of the thoughts or subject; bombast.” Do you see the difference? What makes fustian fustian is not just that the language is pompous—it’s that this pomposity is above the dignity of the thoughts or subject. It’s using fancy language where fancy language isn’t called for. It’s a subtle difference, but that’s the whole point: English is an awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it’s worse than useless. It’s misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their worth and purpose.</em></div>

				<h2>Books</h2>
				<p class="narrowish">This is a list of the books I've read since my first day at college, arranged basically in the order I read them. I have the list both to jog my memory and because I've read a lot of stuff I've loved, and want other people to find it.</p>

				<ul class="booky_list">
					<li><strong>Neuromancer</strong>, William Gibson.</li>
					<li><strong>Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters</strong> and <strong>Seymour: An Introduction
</strong>, J.D. Salinger.
					</li><li><strong>Narcissus and Goldmund</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>What is Thought?</strong>, Eric Baum.</li>
					<li><strong>My Belief: Essays on Life and Art</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>Naomi</strong>, Junichiro Tanizaki.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States_of_America"><strong>The U.S. Constitution</strong></a>.
					</li><li><strong>Demian</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><strong>The Mind's I</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter and Dan Dennett.
						<ul>
							<li>A compendium on the philosophy of mind; Hofstadter and Dennett take turns providing commentary for each of the selected essays/stories.</li>
							<li>
								Highlights: 
								<ol>
									<li>"Computing Machinery and Intelligence", in which Turing proposes his eponymous test.</li>
									<li>"The Turing Test: A Coffeehouse Conversation."</li>
									<li>"Minds, Brains, and Programs" (especially Hofstadter's response).</li>
									<li>Thomas Nagel's classic, "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"</li>
								</ol>
							</li>	
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Permutation City</strong>, Greg Egan.</li>
					<li><strong>The Autobiography of Yukichi Fukuzawa</strong>, Yukichi Fukuzawa.
					</li><li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2775/2775-h/2775-h.htm"><strong>The Good Soldier: A Tale of Passion</strong></a>, Ford Madox Ford.</li>
					<li><strong>The Iliad</strong>, Homer.
					</li><li><strong>Freedom and Neurobiology: Reflections on Free Language Will, and Political Power</strong>, John Searle.
					</li><li><strong>I Am a Strange Loop</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.
						<ul>
							<li>A "softer" and less satisfying version of much of Hofstadter's earlier writing. It may be a good introduction to his ideas for people who don't have time for <em>GEB</em> or find it too technical.</li>
							<li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Am-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter/dp/0465030785">best pages</a> of this book (from the first chapter) are available in Amazon's "Look Inside" reader.</li>
						</ul>
					</li><li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html"><strong>The Waste Land</strong></a>, T.S. Eliot</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The link above points to the <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">raw text online</a> but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waste-Land-Norton-Critical-Editions/dp/0393974995">this print edition</a> has tons of excellent annotations, commentary, and criticism, which are pretty much necessary for a poem this difficult.</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</strong>, Richard P. Feynman</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I have written about Feynman <a href="/blog/feynmans-rigor">here</a>. See this wonderful series of videos, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pYRn5j7oI&amp;feature=related">Fun to Imagine</a>," in which he explains (a) why mirrors seem to reverse left-and-right but not up-and-down, (b) how trains stay on the tracks, and (c) how rubber bands work. Fantastic stuff.</li>
						<li>Other Feynman videos worth watching: <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3164300309410618119#">The Last Journey of a Genius</a>, about his adventure to Tannu Tuva. Warning: a real tear-jerker. Also, of course, <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8777381378502286852#">The Pleasure of Finding Things Out</a>.</li>
						<li>Here's a <a href="http://www.longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine/">great short piece</a> on Feynman's involvement with a massively-parallel supercomputer known as "The Connection Machine."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The God Delusion</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.daoisopen.com/ZhuangziTranslation.html"><strong>Zhuangzi</strong></a>, Zhuangzi.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/"><strong>The Elements of Style</strong></a>, William Strunk Jr. and White, E.B.
					<ul>
						<li>This is a classic and is full of excellent advice about style. But it is dangerous, overly prescriptive, and in many places wrong; <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog%2F+strunk+white&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;oq=&amp;fp=6ffc3260debcd3">do a site search</a> on one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/">The Language Log</a>, to see all of their carefully argued (and vehement) criticism.</li>
						<li>Also read George Orwell's "<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/orwell46.htm">Politics and the English Language.</a>"</li>
					</ul>
					</li><li><strong>The Selfish Gene</strong>, Richard Dawkins.</li>
					<li><strong>Lost in the Funhouse</strong>, John Barth.</li>
					<li><strong>Three Lives</strong>, Gertrude Stein.</li>
					<li><strong>Siddhartha</strong>, Hermann Hesse.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass,_and_What_Alice_Found_There"><strong>Through the Looking Glass</strong></a>, Lewis Carroll.</li>
					<li><strong>The Analects</strong>, Confucius.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>"To learn, and at due times to repeat what one has learnt — is that not after all a pleasure?"</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>To the Lighthouse</strong>, Virginia Woolf</li>
					<li><strong>The Animal Mind</strong>, James L. Gould.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This was heavily cited in Eric Baum's <strong>What is Thought?</strong>, and with good reason: it's full of impressive displays of animal intelligence.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A strange and problematic thesis, but fascinating nonetheless. There is a wonderful line in here where at "odd, unpredictable" moments Dyson found himself "wondering whether trees could think. Not thinking the way we think, but thinking the way trees think; say, two or three hundred years to form the slow trace of an idea."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cosmopolis: The Hidden Agenda of Modernity</strong>, Stephen Toulmin.
					</li><li><strong>Narrative Thought and Narrative Language</strong>, Bruce K. Britton and Anthony D. Pelligrini (eds.).
					</li><li><strong>Life: What a Concept!</strong>, Freeman Dyson, J. Craig Venter, George Church, Robert Shapiro, Dimitar Sasselov, and Seth Lloyd.</li>
					<li><strong>Evariste Galois</strong>, Laura Rigatelli Toti.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">his Wikipedia page</a> — what an exciting and romantic life. I'd like to write a screenplay about it someday.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Art of War</strong>, Sun Tzu.
					</li><li><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</strong>, James Joyce.
					</li><li><strong>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<li><strong>Thus Spake Zarathustra</strong>, Friedrich Nietzsche.
					</li><li><strong>Comeuppance: Costly Altruistic Signaling Punishment, and Other Biological Components of Fiction</strong>, William Flesch.
					</li><li><strong>Franny and Zooey</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<li><strong>Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment</strong>, Richard E. Nisbett and Lee Ross.
					</li><li><strong>Cat's Cradle</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.
					</li><li><strong>Welcome to the Monkey House</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorite collection of Vonnegut stories. What a crisp, straightforward writer, and a brilliant storyteller. He never wastes your time.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Metamagical Themas</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Another compendium from Hofstadter — a collection of all of his <em>Scientific American</em> columns. "Metamagical Themas" is remarkably an anagram of "Mathematical Games," the title of his predecessor Martin Gardner's column (on recreational mathematics). Crazy!</li> 
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction</strong>, Timothy Gowers.
					</li><li><strong>Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity</strong>, John H. Holland</li>
					<ul>
						<li>I had Holland as a professor at the U of M. He was brilliant, and an excellent teacher. I also recommend his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emergence-Chaos-Order-Helix-Books/dp/0738201421"><strong>Emergence: From Chaos To Order</strong></a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A Mathematician's Apology</strong>, G. H. Hardy.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is as good as everyone says it is. Hardy was mostly famous for two things: this book, and discovering the true genius <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Ramanujan</a>. Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Knew-Infinity-Ramanujan/dp/0671750615/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1287514463&amp;sr=1-1">a biography</a> of <em>him</em>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>A People's History of the United States</strong>, Howard Zinn.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Like Will Hunting says, this one will blow your hair back.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Big Lebowski: The Making of a Coen Brothers Film</strong>, Tricia Cooke and William Preston Robertson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Shows the Coen brothers' obsessive attention to detail. Every shot is storyboarded, and every piece of the production — wardrobes, lighting, casting, etc. — is meticulously planned. They're the Joyce of filmmaking.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</strong>, Thomas S. Kuhn</li>
					<li><strong>Ceci N'est Pas Une Pipe</strong>, Michel Foucault.</li>
					<li><strong>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of my favorite short fiction is in here. See, e.g., <a href="/bi-20.html">this</a> and <a href="/bi-48.html">this</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Breaking The Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon</strong>, Daniel Dennett.</li>
					<li><strong>Dialogues with Children</strong>, Gareth Mathews.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Proof that children can do philosophy, and a study of an excellent teacher in action.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Remarks on Color</strong>, Ludwig Wittgenstein.
					</li><li><strong>Tao Te Ching</strong>, Laozi.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Drastically overrated.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Diamond Age</strong>, Neal Stephenson.
					</li><li><strong>Hamlet</strong>, William Shakespeare.</li>
					<li><strong>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</strong>, Edward Tufte.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worthwhile even if all you learn is to maximize his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte#Information_design">"data-ink" ratio</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science</strong>, Atul Gawande.</li>
					<li><strong>Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind</strong>, V. S. Ramachandran.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of the coolest — i.e., the most fascinating — stuff I've ever read. This book may tempt you to drop everything for a career in neurology or cognitive neuroscience.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Dubliners</strong>, James Joyce.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My professor called <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/958/">"The Dead"</a> the best short story of all time. "Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age."</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Autobiography of Malcolm X</strong>, Malcolm X with Alex Haley.
					</li><li><strong>Nine Stories</strong>, Salinger, J.D.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Some of these stories took Salinger more than a year to write, each. It paid off — they're incredible. Gems.</li>

					<li><strong>Zingerman's Guide to Giving Great Service</strong>, Ari Weinzweig.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://zingermans.com">Zingerman's</a>, in Ann Arbor, MI, is arguably the best (and <a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20030101/25036.html">best-run</a>) deli outside of New York. And part of what makes it so special is their <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/983-good-company-zingermans">highly regarded</a> company culture and especially the way they treat customers. This book is a great guide for doing that yourself, as most of the ideas and advice are less about the restaurant industry than the giving-people-what-they-want industry.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>On Bullshit</strong>, Harry G. Frankfurt.</li>
					<li><strong>I Want to Be a Mathematician</strong>, Paul R. Halmos</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What an incredible book — I will have it by my bedside wherever I live.</li>
						<li>Halmos was a beautiful writer and a hard worker. Here's what he had to say on the subject:
							<blockquote>Archimedes taught us that a small quantity added to itself often enough becomes a large quantity (or, in proverbial terms, every little bit helps). When it comes to accomplishing the bulk of the world's work, and, in particular, when it comes to writing a book, I believe that the converse of Archimedes' teaching is also true: the only way to write a large book is to keep writing a small bit of it, steadily every day, with no exception, with no holiday.</blockquote>

					<li><strong>Snow Crash</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>Godel's Proof</strong>, Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>It's hard to overstate the importance of what Godel achieved. Nagel and Newman do a superb job of explaining his remarkably clever and loopy proof, a proof which inspired Hofstadter to write the incomparable <strong>Godel, Escher, Bach</strong>. In fact, this is one of Hofstadter's favorite books.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Winesburg, Ohio</strong>, Sherwood Anderson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A study of "grotesques." As some writer says in the afterword, it has a lot to teach us about humility, ambivalence, and self-doubt.</li>

					<li><strong>Tinkers</strong>, Paul Harding.</li>
					<li><strong>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</strong>, Richard Feynman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Self-recommending. Read it with an eye toward Feynman's disposition, his particular way of thinking — concretely, simply, with a hard reflex against the <em>illusion</em> of understanding.</li>

					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Little Schemer</strong>, Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book. From essentially nothing, it builds you up to the point where you can write (or at least understand) (a) the applicative-order fixed point combinator for functionals, and (b) an interpreter for the very language you're writing in.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/derivation-of-ycombinator">a readable derivation of the Y combinator</a> based on the one given in the book.</li>
						<li>Here's <a href="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/jmc.ps">a more compact attempt</a>, by Paul Graham, to build a Lisp interpreter from the ground up.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem</strong>, ed. Jonathan Shear.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of papers responding to David Chalmers's "<a href="http://consc.net/papers/facing.html">Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness</a>," in which he famously introduces the term "the hard problem." The hard problem is the problem of explaining how first-person phenomenal experiences—colors, tastes, itches, pains, thoughts, moods, mental images, feels, etc.—arise in the brain, which looks to be nothing more than a really complicated collection of jiggling atoms, just like everything else in our physical world.</li>
						<li>A good portion of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=t4KNDxsj7fcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=site:books.google.com+explaining+consciousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o1jQhAg96G&amp;sig=H0Qi6UQuCPAkVPfMtwI-y_d6e3c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hCbhTN6hL4L48AaWjbm7Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">the book</a> is available online at Google Books. Since it's just a collection of papers, it should be easy enough to find whatever you need.</li>
						<li>Chalmers's <a href="http://consc.net/papers/moving.html">response</a> to the responses might be a good way of getting a lay of the land without having to trudge through 400 pages of detailed arguments.</li>
						<li>If anything the book chipped away at my staunch materialism. I feel a lot more open to Chalmers's view, which initially struck me as almost laughably absurd. The hard problem is so hard, I now think, that it warrants quite drastic moves, like introducing something fundamental to the ontology of the world.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Armageddon in Retrospect</strong>, Kurt Vonnegut.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A collection of his writings on war, both fiction and nonfiction. Quite good.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Communication With Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI), Proceedings of a conference held at the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory, Yerevan, USSR, 5-11 September 1971</strong>, edited by Carl Sagan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>One of maybe two or three of the most interesting books I've read.</li>
						<li>The chief aims of the conference were, first, to estimate values for terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation#The_equation">Drake equation</a>, and second, to devise strategies for contact. Necessarily, then, they had to discuss a remarkable range of topics—everything from the chemical origins of life, to the anthropology of early civilizations, to the problem of encoding messages in a form comprehensible to intelligences vastly unlike ourselves.</li>
						<li>The conferencegoers were some of the top scientists from around the	world, chiefly the US and USSR. And if anything the pleasure here is in watching them think and debate in a relatively informal setting. It's a wonderful mix of prepared talks and extemporaneous discussion.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of Paul Erdős and the Search for Mathematical Truth</strong>, Paul Hoffman.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A wonderful book about a wonderful man. Captivating, fast, and fun. Erdős was the most prolific mathematician who ever lived, publishing 1,475 papers, many of them hugely important.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Honeybee Democracy</strong>, Thomas D. Seeley.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>First, Seeley explains in wonderfully lucid detail just how bees go about finding their new homes (nest sites). I came away feeling like an expert on the subject—no doubt a testament to Seeley's expository skill. Second, the illustrations are fantastic: Edward Tufte would be proud. Finally, this serves nicely as a case study in basic science: how to explore, how to ask useful questions, how to design experiments, how to patiently collect data, how to make sense of your results, and how to tell a coherent story about them.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms</strong>, Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Provocative, in both good and bad ways.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cryptonomicon</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Easily one of my favorite books. This is actually the second time I've read it—the first was in high school, and unfortunately I think much of it went over my head (though it probably influenced me in all kinds of subtle ways). It's a book that repays many returns.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>For a Breath I Tarry</strong>, Roger Zelazny.</li>
					<li><strong>How Animals Work</strong>, Knut Schmidt-Nielsen.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>There is a surprising and fascinating detail every five pages or so. It gets a bit technical, but the writing is remarkably understated and lucid.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>How the Mind Works</strong>, Steven Pinker.</li>
					<li><strong>And Then We Came to the End</strong>, Joshua Ferris.</li>
					<li><strong>Palindromes and Anagrams</strong>, Howard W. Bergerson.</li>
					<li><strong>Le Ton beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Langauge</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quintessential Hofstadter.</li>
						<li>The index for this book apparently took Hofstadter one full month of fifteen-hour days to pull off, which, when you see it, seems like not nearly enough time!</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Yours Ever: People and Their Letters</strong>, Thomas Mallon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Mallon is an excellent editor, writer, and reader, and a wonderful tour guide through centuries of private lives.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Impro: Improvisation and the Theatre</strong>, Keith Johnstone.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Protagoras"><strong>Protagoras</strong></a>, Plato.</li>
					<li><strong>One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science</strong>, George Gamow.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This is a book that should be printed in massive quantities and sprinkled everyplace youngsters hang out, in the hope that just a few of them pick it up and delightedly fall headfirst into a life of science.</li>
						<li>Deserving of all its praise (see for example the distribution of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Two-Three-Infinity-Speculations/product-reviews/0486256642/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">reviews on Amazon</a>).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Screwtape Letters</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Incisive chronicle of the many ways humans stray from the good life. Lewis is a master observer of subtly pernicious psychology.</li>
						<li>Amusing, witty, and wise, just like most of Lewis's stuff.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Martian Chronicles</strong>, Ray Bradbury.</li>
					<li><strong>Star Maker</strong>, Olaf Stapledon.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Wildly imaginative but maybe too abstract, lacking the standard hooks of successful speculative fiction (like characters, or detailed close-ups of the worlds).</li>
						<li>Stellar prose. It's florid but not purple and laced with an almost biblical majesty.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor</strong>, Paul Farmer.</li>
					<li><strong>Mere Christianity</strong>, C. S. Lewis.</li>
					<li><strong>C. S. Lewis's Lost Aeneid</strong>, C. S. Lewis, ed. A. T. Reynes.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Lewis is a wonderful translator.</li>
						<li>Only books one, two, and six are translated at any length, enough to show that the Aeneid is a hell of a story.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The John McPhee Reader</strong>, John McPhee, ed. William L. Howarth.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>When I grow up, what would I like to be? A modified John McPhee!</li>
						<li>It's hard to overstate how much I admire McPhee's work and writing. He's a master craftsman. Howarth's introduction tells and the rest of the book shows.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Let the Great World Spin</strong>, Colum McCann.</li>
					<li><strong>Maximum City</strong>, Suketu Mehta.</li>
					<li><strong>Field Notes on Science and Nature</strong>, ed. Michael R. Canfield.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A beautiful, readable, very <em>useful</em> book.</li>
						<li>One is quickly sold on the power of narratives and sketches, and notes in general, for recording information, remembering stuff, and most important, propelling the mind into a reflective observant mode.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Zodiac</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<li><strong>The Best American Essays (2010)</strong>, ed. Christopher Hitchens.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>My favorites were "Gyromancy," "The Elegant Eyeball," "On John Updike," "Irreconcilable Dissonance," "The Dead Book," and "My Genome, My Self," in that order.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements</strong>, Nils J. Nilsson.</li>
					<li><strong>Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: The Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought</strong>, Douglas Hofstadter.</li>
					<li><strong>Beatrice and Virgil</strong>, Yann Martel.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very quick read, and very suspenseful. You're drawn through the book on your tiptoes. But I kept waiting for the story to gear up in earnest, and kept waiting, until I had only a slim fingerful of pages left and nothing meaty yet had happened. I was left unsatisfied.</li>
						<li>"Unsatisfied," I say, except that the last few pages, particularly the short "games"... they're incredible.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Angels and Ages: A Short Book About Darwin, Lincoln, and Modern Life</strong>, Adam Gopnik.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Way, way better than you probably think it's going to be. Gopnik is a brilliant essayist.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>REAMDE</strong>, Neal Stephenson.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Stephenson is a very indulgent writer. A friend at work said he was like an investigative journalist of his own imagination. When a character plugs in a router, it's 500 words about router configuration; when someone has to pick a lock, it's an essay on lock-picking and hacker culture; anytime a gun goes off it's a very careful description of bolts and safeties and the heft of the thing and firing mechanisms; when the plot calls for a flight across the Pacific it's a whole chapter's worth of great circle routes and the "what it's like" of bizjet travel. All very accurate. This is why I mostly like reading his stuff, because you <em>learn</em> so much in a tasty plot package.</li>
						<li>If I like <em>REAMDE</em> less than some of his other books, though, it's because the stuff he ends up teaching here is not as super interesting as the stuff, say, in <em>Cryptonomicon</em> or <em>The Diamond Age</em>. (I feel like I'd be much better at paintball after reading this book; in fact I was watching Die Hard 2 not too long after and the whole time I was thinking of how pathetically thoughtless all the maneuvers and tactics were in that movie, as compared to what I'd "seen" in Stephenson's book.)</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Sparse Distributed Memory</strong>, Pentti Kanerva.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A coherent high-level account of how memory might work. Neurons are attractors in a space of bitstrings, which code for on/off features in the world. Bitstrings address neurons, which store addresses to other neurons; the chain either diverges (no recall) or converges to the best match.</li>
						<li>The mathematics of the space {0, 1}<sup>N</sup> ensure, first, that any two points chosen at random are far apart, but always closely connectable by a third; and second—for that reason—that a sparse and manageably-sized collection of address decoders (neurons) is sufficient to solve the best-match problem when N is massive (~10,000).</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Q.E.D: Beauty in Mathematical Proof</strong>, Burkard Polster.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A very short book with beautiful illustrations of elegant proofs.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation</strong>, Jon Gertner.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Worth reading just for its account of the invention of the transistor. Great material, too, on Claude Shannon.</li>
						<li>Includes a very interesting concluding chapter that tries to explain what made Bell Labs so successful, and where we might find something similar today. Is it Silicon Valley? (No.) Gertner wrote a summary of that argument for the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/innovation-and-the-bell-labs-miracle.html?pagewanted=all">here</a>.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry</strong>, Jon Ronson.</li>
					<li><strong>Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche</strong>, Haruki Murakami.</li>
					<li><strong>My First Summer in the Sierra</strong>, John Muir.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>What I would give to have one day of Muir's summer, or better yet, one small ounce of his happy attitude.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Lady in the Looking-Glass</strong>, Virginia Woolf.</li>
					<li><strong>The Way of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism</strong>, Martin Buber.</li>
					<li><strong>The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</strong>, Douglas Adams.</li>
					<li><strong>Final Approach: The Crash of Eastern 212</strong>, William Stockton.</li>
					<li><strong>The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley's Most Exclusive School for Startups</strong>, Randall Stross.</li>
					<li><strong>The Grasshopper: Games, Life and Utopia</strong>, Bernard Suits.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The editorial review summarizes well: "In the mid twentieth century the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein famously asserted that games are indefinable; there are no common threads that link them all. 'Nonsense,' says the sensible Bernard Suits: 'playing a game is a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.' The short book Suits wrote demonstrating precisely that is as playful as it is insightful, as stimulating as it is delightful."</li>
						<li>This book is a shining example of philosophical thinking, of intellectual integrity: it articulates in the best possible light the best objections to its thesis, "come what may." That it manages convincingly to knock them all down is just icing. And in style: it's been a long while since I've read writing this clear, and yet it's not overbearing—it manages to be both precise and light.</li>
						<li>Another one of those special books that I read on a whim and that will, I fear, never be read by anyone I recommend it to.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Cloud Atlas</strong>, David Mitchell.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>As good as everyone says. Mitchell is an unbelievable prose stylist.</li>
						<li>My favorite was the long chapter that spanned the middle of the book. I preferred the second halves of the stories more often than the first halves; I particularly enjoyed the second half of the Frobisher letters.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</strong>, Robin Sloan.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Quick, unserious, but very engrossing. A joy to read.</li>
					</ul>
					<li><strong>The Corrections</strong>, Jonathan Franzen.</li>
					<li><strong>How to Win Friends and Influence People</strong>, Dale Carnegie.</li>
					<ul>
            <li>Rightfully a classic; not so self-helpy as you'd think.</li>
            <li>Quoted on p. 75: "Whenever you go out of doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp."</li>
            <li>Fundamentally people want a sense of importance. "William James said: 'The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.'"</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>The Imperfectionists</strong>, Tom Rachman.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>A great read, and devastating.</li>
          </ul>
          <li><strong>Both Flesh and Not: Essays</strong>, David Foster Wallace.</li>
          <li><strong>Turing's Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe</strong>, George Dyson.</li>
          <li><strong>The Giver</strong>, Lois Lowry.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I remember liking <em>The Giver</em> when I, along with millions of other American kids, read it in middle school. And I remember liking it because it was cryptic—it gestured at something secretly significant. And that in itself is interesting, because re-reading it now I can see that it <em>isn't</em>, as it turns out, a cryptic book. It's actually pretty straightforward—still great, but no longer glowing with some ineffable magic. What does that mean? Does it mean my mind's gotten stronger, or weaker?</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Stephenson might have the best job in the world. You can see how he uses his novels to dive into subjects that interest him. In that sense he's a lot like a journalist. These projects are an excuse for him to study and talk to smart people and even to do original research over the course of many years. In this book those topics include: orbital mechanics, mining culture, the physics of chains, big space engineering, epigenetics, and glider flight.</li>
        <li>The premise and storyline of this book might be the best Stephenson has ever come up with. The moon blows up in the first sentence; this causes a chain reaction that will, it is calculated, wipe out the planet in two years. The action takes place in three parts; the first and last of these are gripping and fascinating. The last part in particular is fun to read and imaginative. The middle part is a slog, and takes up about ten times too many pages. One consequence of Stephenson being (it seems) a scholar first and a storyteller second is that he indulges in technical detail. When he's describing new worlds, and the story is moving fast (as in the third section), that's welcome—but when the going is slow, all the minutiae is painful.</li>

      <li><strong>The Beautiful and Damned</strong>, F. Scott Fitzgerald</li>
      <li><strong>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work</strong>, Alain de Botton</li>
      <ul>
        <li>An unusual little book that ought to be read widely. It's a generous, funny, thoughtful look at the work that we do now—in logistics, in back offices, in science and infrastructure engineering—and what that means.</li>
        <li>The chapter on painting was my favorite.</li>
        <li>de Botton has a roving, essaying style sort of like DFW's in his nonfiction—he goes places and meets strangers, like a reporter, but instead of merely reporting he shows you what's going on inside his head. It makes for a more entertaining read, and it feels more honest.</li>

      <li><strong>The Stand</strong>, Stephen King</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Maybe the most gripping novel I've read. The characters and scenes are incredibly vivid—King writes in a way where you <em>see</em> everything that's happening. And it's hard to imagine a more compelling premise and plot. The characters felt alive.</li>
        <li>This will be my go-to recommendation to anyone looking for a fun, engaging read. The perfect beach or subway book.</li>

      <li><strong>Pale Fire</strong>, Vladimir Nabokov</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I believe Kinbote is the author of Canto IV.</li>
        <li>The poem itself is, I think, a great work of literature, and it's a stroke of genius to have embedded it in this strange novel, first because it must have greatly multiplied the poem's audience, and second because it has a way of weakening your critical stance toward it—you don't go into it thinking, "Here's a poem I must criticize," but thinking rather, "Oh, how neat—a little poem."</li>

      <li><strong>The New Bloomsday Book: A Guide Through Ulysses</strong>, Harry Blamires</li>
      <ul>
        <li>My book group has been reading <em>Ulysses</em>, and this guide has been indispensable—reading it before each chapter of <em>U</em> made what was literally going on in each scene vastly more accessible.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Sourdough</strong>, Robin Sloan</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Such a joyful book—and a joy to read. I may have even liked it more than <em>Penumbra</em>. This one has that same infectious love for the world.</li>

        <li><strong>Once a Runner</strong>, John L. Parker Jr.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>More people should write books like this: fictional odes to the thing they love.</li>

        <li><strong>Childhood's End</strong>, Arthur C. Clarke</li>
        <li><strong>The Machinery of Life</strong>, David S. Goodsell</li>
        <ul>
          <li>What a book! Required reading, and especially so for high schoolers and college students. I wasn't much interested in bio as a student but now am hungry to learn more about it, and sort of wish I'd fallen down the rabbit-hole when I was in school. This book would have been a great way in.</li>
          <li>I first heard about it via <a href="http://www.righto.com/2011/07/cells-are-very-fast-and-crowded-places.html">this blog post</a> about how cells are "very fast and crowded places." Indeed, in the first few chapters of the book, this model of the inside of a cell is articulated very clearly.
          <p>I'd always wondered what it meant for genes to be "expressed" and <em>when</em> exactly this would happen, how long it would go on, how often it would be repeated. This book gave me a mental model of the cell that explains gene expression in a simple way: our transcription machinery, like all proteins in the cell, are bouncing around at random, very quickly, encountering other molecules to bind with (or not); when they encounter DNA, they transcribe ("express") it. Gene expression is modulated—genes are "turned off" or on—when the DNA encoding that gene is literally hidden from the transcription machinery, by being packed into the crevasses of tight chromatin bundles.</p></li>
          <li>There are lots of drawings by Goodsell, along with videos, explanations, and other stuff, at the <a href="http://pdb101.rcsb.org/">protein data bank</a>.</li>

        <li><strong>The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA</strong>, James D. Watson</li>

        <li><strong>Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th-century Admiral Turned Science into Poetry</strong>, Scott Huler</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A surprisingly wonderful book whose basic point is to pay closer attention to the world around you—a bit like <i>Field Notes on Science and Nature</i>.</li>
          <li>I was inspired to write my own <a href="/beaufort-turbulence.html">Beaufortian scale for airplane turbulence</a>.</li>
        </ul>
	<li><strong>My Brilliant Friend</strong>, Elena Ferrante.</li>
	<li><strong>11/22/63</strong>, Stephen King.</li>
	<li><strong>Sing, Unburied, Sing</strong>, Jesmyn Ward.</li>
	<li><strong>Jurassic Park</strong>, Michael Crichton.</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Wow! An incredibly captivating read. And complements the movie: both were ideal versions of the story for their form. Here in the book you get lots more motivation and justification—it's very technical to the point of seeming real.</li>
	  <li>Makes me want Crichton's job: study a world of science or engineering in great depth, and as payment, produce page-turning fiction about it.</li>
	  <li>Did you know that at one point, Chrichton <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/michael-crichton-reign-over-pop-culture-jurassic-park-westworld">had</a> the nation's #1 bestselling book, the top movie at the box office, and the most-watched television series, <em>all at the same time</em>—and that this happened TWICE (!)?</li>

	  <li>My friend Ben and I wrote a New York Times crossword puzzle, which appeared in print on Saturday, October 20th 2018. You can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/svc/crosswords/v2/puzzle/print/Oct2018.pdf">download it here if you're an NYT subscriber</a>.</li>
          <li>I <a href="features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs">reverse-engineered Google Docs</a> to create <a href="http://draftback.com">Draftback</a>, a tool which allows you to play back any Google Doc's history as though it were a movie. (<a href="http://draftback.com/documents/1fFdqVj7XnBBcKyytm8u8mqMtPInv10ntP79uHICfGVQ">See an example here</a>, from a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/watch-me-write-this-article/">FiveThirtyEight article</a> about the tool.) It has more than 300,000 users, most of them teachers and students. Here's a note about how it's being used in the classroom, from <a href="https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/draftback-to-the-future-a-tool-for-writing-process-analysis/">the <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em></a>.</li>
          <li>My friend Ben and I made a typewriter that sends its keystrokes in real time to a Google Doc. We call it <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/docwriter">the DocWriter</a>.</li>
          <li>I created a tool for reporters that syncs notes to a recording, and generates a <a href="http://jsomers.net/call">timecoded transcript</a>.</li>
          <li>I've made a very simple typewriter simulator (a text editor where you can't hit Delete) at <a href="http://jsomers.net/typewriter">jsomers.net/typerwriter</a>.</li>
					<li>As discussed in <a href="/blog/directions">this blog post</a>, I tapped into the Google Directions API to answer a few neat questions about driving directions, including "What's the most complicated route in the United States?" The relevant code is <a href="https://github.com/jsomers/directions">here</a>.</li>
					<li>I wrote up my solution to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problem #106 in <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/pe-oeis">this blog post</a>.
